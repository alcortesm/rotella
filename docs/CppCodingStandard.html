<h1> Introduction </h1>

<a name="important"></a>
<h2> Standardization is Important </h2>

It helps if the standard annoys everyone in some way so everyone
feels they are on the same playing field. The proposal here
has evolved over many projects, many companies, and literally
a total of many weeks spent arguing. It is no particular person's style
and is certainly open to local amendments.

<h3> Good Points </h3>

When a project tries to adhere to common standards a few
good things happen:
<ul>
<li> Programmers can go into any code and figure out what's going on.
</li><li> New people can get up to speed quickly.
</li><li> People new to C++ are spared the need to develop a personal
     style and defend it to the death.
</li><li> People new to C++ are spared making the same mistakes over
     and over again.
</li><li> People make fewer mistakes in consistent environments.
</li><li> Programmers have a common enemy :-)
</li></ul>


<h3> Bad Points </h3>

Now the bad:

<ul>
<li> The standard is usually stupid because it was made by someone
     who doesn't understand C++.
</li><li> The standard is usually stupid because it's not what I do.
</li><li> Standards reduce creativity.
</li><li> Standards are unnecessary as long as people are consistent.
</li><li> Standards enforce too much structure.
</li><li> People ignore standards anyway.
</li><li> Standards can be used as a reason for NIH (not invented here)
     because the new/borrowed code won't follow the standard.
</li></ul>

<h3> Discussion </h3>

The experience of many projects leads to the conclusion that using
coding standards makes the project go smoother. Are standards
necessary for success? Of course not. But they help, and we need all the
help we can get! Be honest, most arguments against a particular
standard come from the ego. Few decisions in a reasonable standard really
can be said to be technically deficient, just matters of taste.
So be flexible, control the ego a bit, and remember any project
is fundamentally a team effort.
<p>



</p><p><a name="enforce"></a>
</p><h2> Standards Enforcement </h2>

First, any serious concerns about the standard should be brought
up and worked out within the group. Maybe the standard is not
quite appropriate for your situation. It may have overlooked
important issues or maybe someone in power vehemently
disagrees with certain issues :-)
<p>

In any case, once finalized hopefully people will play the adult and 
understand that this standard is reasonable, and has been found reasonable 
by many other programmers, and therefore is worthy of being followed
even with personal reservations.
</p><p>

Failing willing cooperation it can be made a requirement that
this standard must be followed to pass a code inspection.
</p><p>

Failing that the only solution is a massive tickling party on the 
offending party.
</p><p>

<a name="accept"></a>
</p><h2> Accepting an Idea </h2>

<ol>
<li> It's impossible.
</li><li> Maybe it's possible, but it's weak and uninteresting.
</li><li> It is true and I told you so.
</li><li> I thought of it first.
</li><li> How could it be otherwise.
</li></ol>

If you come to objects with a negative preconception please
keep an open mind. You may still conclude objects are bunk,
but there's a road you must follow to accept something different. 
Allow yourself to travel it for a while.

Consensus is great. If it lasts for the project lifecycle,
consider yourself blessed.  I've been on a couple projects
where two engineers just blantantly <b>disagreed</b>!
They were always:
</a><p>

<a name="leader">Programmer #1 says " x = 1"  <br>
Programmer #2 says " x != 1"

<h1> Names </h1>

<p></p><hr><a name="descriptive">
</a><h1><a name="descriptive"> Make Names Fit </a></h1>

<a name="descriptive">Names are the heart of programming. In the
past people believed knowing someone's true name gave them magical
power over that person. If you can think up the true name for something,
you give yourself and the people coming after power over the code.
Don't laugh! </a><p>

<a name="descriptive">A name is the result of a long deep thought process about
the ecology it lives in. Only a programmer who understands the system as a whole
can create a name that "fits" with the system. If the name is appropriate 
everything fits together naturally, relationships are clear, meaning is derivable,
and reasoning from common human expectations works as expected. </a></p><p>

<a name="descriptive">If you find all your names could be Thing and DoIt then you should probably
revisit your design. </a></p><p></p><h3><a name="descriptive"> <b>Class Names</b> </a></h3>

<ul>
<li><a name="descriptive"> Name the class after what it is. If you can't think of what it is that is a clue
     you have not thought through the design well enough. 
</a></li><li><a name="descriptive"> Compound names of over three words are a clue your design may be confusing
     various entities in your system. Revisit your design. Try a CRC card session
     to see if your objects have more responsibilities than they should.
</a></li><li><a name="descriptive"> Avoid the temptation of bringing the name of the class a class derives from into the
     derived class's name. A class should stand on its own. It doesn't
     matter what it derives from.
</a></li><li><a name="descriptive"> Suffixes are sometimes helpful. For example, if your system uses agents then naming 
     something DownloadAgent conveys real information.
</a></li></ul>

<h3><a name="descriptive"> Method and Function Names </a></h3>

<ul>
<li><a name="descriptive"> 
Usually every method and function performs an action, so the name
should make clear what it does: CheckForErrors()
instead of ErrorCheck(), DumpDataToFile() instead of DataFile().
This will also make functions and data objects more distinguishable.
</a><p>

<a name="descriptive">Classes are often nouns. By making function names verbs and following 
other naming conventions programs can be read more naturally.
</a></p><p>

</p></li><li><a name="descriptive"> 
Suffixes are sometimes useful:
     </a><ul>
<a name="descriptive">     </a><li><a name="descriptive"> <i>Max</i> - to mean the maximum value something can have.
     </a></li><li><a name="descriptive"> <i>Cnt</i> - the current count of a running count variable.
     </a></li><li><a name="descriptive"> <i>Key</i> - key value.
     </a></li></ul><p>
<a name="descriptive">     For example: RetryMax to mean the maximum number of retries, RetryCnt to
     mean the current retry count. 
</a></p><p>

</p></li><li><a name="descriptive"> 
Prefixes are sometimes useful:
     </a><ul>
<a name="descriptive">     </a><li><a name="descriptive"> <i>Is</i> - to ask a question about something. Whenever someone sees <i>Is</i> they
          will know it's a question.
     </a></li><li><a name="descriptive"> <i>Get</i> - get a value.
     </a></li><li><a name="descriptive"> <i>Set</i> - set a value.
     </a></li></ul><p>
<a name="descriptive">     For example: IsHitRetryLimit. 
</a></p><p>
</p></li></ul>


<p></p><hr><a name="units">
</a><h1><a name="units"> Include Units in Names </a></h1>

<a name="units">If a variable represents time, weight, or some other unit then include the 
unit in the name so developers can more easily spot problems.
For example:
</a><pre><a name="units">uint32 mTimeoutMsecs;
uint32 mMyWeightLbs;
</a></pre>

<a name="units">Better yet is to make a variable into a class so bad conversions
can be caught.


</a><p></p><hr><a name="noabbrev">
</a><h1><a name="noabbrev"> No All Upper Case Abbreviations </a></h1>

<ul>
<li><a name="noabbrev"> When confronted with a situation where you could use an all
     upper case abbreviation instead use an initial upper case
     letter followed by all lower case letters. No matter what.
</a></li></ul>

<h3><a name="noabbrev"> Justification </a></h3>

<ul>
<li><a name="noabbrev"> People seem to have very different intuitions when making names
     containing abbreviations. It's best to settle on one strategy 
     so the names are absolutely predictable. 
     </a><p>
<a name="noabbrev">     Take for example <i>NetworkABCKey</i>. Notice
     how the C from ABC and K from key are confused. Some people don't
     mind this and others just hate it so you'll find different
     policies in different code so you never know what to call something.
</a></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="noabbrev"> Example </a></h3>
<pre><a name="noabbrev">   class FluidOz             // NOT FluidOZ
   class NetworkAbcKey       // NOT NetworkABCKey
</a></pre>


<p></p><hr><a name="classnames"></a>
<h1> Class Names </h1>

<ul>
<li> Use upper case letters as word separators, lower case for the rest of a word
</li><li> First character in a name is upper case
</li><li> No underbars ('_')
</li></ul>

<h3> Justification </h3>

<ul>
<li> Of all the different naming strategies many people found this one the 
     best compromise.
</li></ul>

<h3> Example </h3>
<pre>   class NameOneTwo
  
   class Name
</pre>


<p></p><hr><a name="classlnames">
</a><h1><a name="classlnames"> Class Library Names </a></h1>

<ul>
<li><a name="classlnames"> Now that name spaces are becoming more widely implemented, name spaces
     should be used to prevent class name conflicts among libraries
	 from different vendors and groups.
</a></li><li><a name="classlnames"> When not using name spaces, it's common to prevent class name clashes by
     prefixing class names with a unique string. Two characters is sufficient,
     but a longer length is fine. 
</a></li></ul>

<h3><a name="classlnames"> Example </a></h3>

<a name="classlnames">John Johnson's complete data structure library could use <i>JJ</i>
as a prefix, so classes would be:
</a><pre><a name="classlnames">   class JjLinkList
   {
   }
</a></pre>


<p></p><hr><a name="methodsnames">
</a><h1><a name="methodsnames"> Method Names </a></h1>

<ul>
<li><a name="methodsnames"> Use the same rule as for class names.
</a></li></ul>

<h3><a name="methodsnames"> Justification </a></h3>

<ul>
<li><a name="methodsnames"> Of all the different naming strategies many people found this one the 
     best compromise.
</a></li></ul>

<h3><a name="methodsnames"> Example </a></h3>

   }
</a></pre>


<p></p><hr><a name="attrnames"></a>
<h1> Class Attribute Names </h1>

<ul>
<li> Attribute names should be prepended with the character 'm'. 
</li><li> After the 'm' use the same rules as for class names.
</li><li> 'm' always precedes other name modifiers like 'p' for pointer.
</li></ul>

<h3> Justification </h3>

<ul>
<li> Prepending 'm' prevents any conflict with method names. Often your
     methods and attribute names will be similar, especially for
     accessors.
</li></ul>

<h3> Example </h3>
<pre>   class NameOneTwo
   {
   public:
      int                   VarAbc();
      int                   ErrorNumber();

   }
</pre>


<p></p><hr><a name="margnames"></a>
<h1> Method Argument Names </h1>

<ul>
<li> The first character should be lower case.
</li><li> All word beginnings after the first letter should be upper case
     as with class names.
</li></ul>

<h3> Justification </h3>

<ul>
<li> You can always tell which variables are passed in variables.
</li><li> You can use names similar to class names without conflicting with class names.
</li></ul>

<h3> Example </h3>
<pre>   class NameOneTwo

   public:
      int                   StartYourEngines(
                               Engine&amp; rSomeEngine,

</a></li></ul>

<h3><a name="stacknames"> Justification </a></h3>

<ul>
<li><a name="stacknames"> With this approach the scope of the variable is clear in
     the code.
</a></li><li><a name="stacknames"> Now all variables look different and are identifiable in the code.

      ErrorProcessor error_processor;
      Time*          p_out_of_time= 0;
   }
</a></pre>
<p>

<a name="stacknames">The standard pointer notation is not entirely satisfactory because it doesn't look quite
right, but it is consistent.
</a></p><p>

<a name="stacknames">How do you handle statics? There's never a reason to have a static local to
a function so there's no reason to invent a syntax for it. But like for most
absolute rules, there is an exception, that is when making singletons. Use a "s_" prefix 
in this case.
Take a look at </a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">Singleton Pattern</a>
for more details.
</p><p>


</p><p></p><hr><a name="pnames"></a>
<h1> Pointer Variables </h1>

<ul>
<li> pointers should be prepended by a 'p' in most cases
</li><li> place the <i>*</i> close to the pointer type not the variable name
</li></ul>

<h3> Justification </h3>

<ul>
<li> The idea is that the difference between a pointer, object, and a 
     reference to an object is important for understanding the code,
     especially in C++ where <i>-&gt;</i> can be overloaded, and casting
     and copy semantics are important.
</li><li> 
Pointers really are a change of type so the <i>*</i> belongs near the type.
One reservation with this policy relates to declaring multiple variables
with the same type on the same line. In C++ the pointer modifier only applies 
to the closest variable, not all of them, which can be very confusing, 
especially for newbies. You want to have one declaration per line anyway
so you can document each variable.

</li></ul>

<h3> Example </h3>
<pre>  String* pName= new String;

  String* pName, name, address; // note, only pName is a pointer.
</pre>


<p></p><hr><a name="rnames">
</a><h1><a name="rnames"> Reference Variables and Functions Returning References</a></h1>

<ul>
<li><a name="rnames"> References should be prepended with 'r'.
</a></li></ul>

<h3><a name="rnames"> Justification </a></h3>

<ul>
<li><a name="rnames"> The difference between variable types is clarified.
</a></li><li><a name="rnames"> It establishes the difference between a method returning a 
     modifiable object and the same method name returning a 
     non-modifiable object.
</a></li></ul>

<h3><a name="rnames"> Example </a></h3>
<pre><a name="rnames">   class Test
   {
   public:

<h3><a name="gnames"> Justification </a></h3>

<ul>
<li><a name="gnames"> It's important to know the scope of a variable.
</a></li></ul>

<h3><a name="gnames"> Example </a></h3>

<h3><a name="gconstants"> Justification </a></h3>

<a name="gconstants">It's tradition for global constants to named this way.

<h3> Example </h3>
<pre>   class Test

<p></p><hr><a name="tnames"></a>
<h1> Type Names </h1>

<ul>
<li> When possible for types based on native types make a typedef.
</li><li> Typedef names should use the same naming policy as for a class
     with the word <i>Type</i> appended.
</li></ul>

<h3> Justification </h3>

<ul>
<li> Of all the different naming strategies many people found this one the 
     best compromise.
</li><li> Types are things so should use upper case letters. <i>Type</i>
     is appended to make it clear this is not a class.
</li></ul>

<pre>   typedef uint16  ModuleType;
   typedef uint32  SystemType;

      PIN_OFF,
      PIN_ON
   };
</a></pre>

<h2><a name="enames"> Enums as Constants without Class Scoping </a></h2>

<a name="enames">Sometimes people use enums as constants. When an enum is not
embedded in a class make sure you use some sort of differentiating
name before the label so as to prevent name clashes.

</a><h3><a name="enames"> Example </a></h3>
<pre><a name="enames">   enum PinStateType            If <i>PIN</i> was not prepended a conflict 
   {                            would occur as OFF and ON are probably
      PIN_OFF,                  already defined.

<h2><a name="enames"> Enums with Class Scoping </a></h2>

<a name="enames">Just name the enum items what you wish and always qualify
with the class name: Aclass::PIN_OFF.


</a><h2><a name="enames"> Make a Label for an Error State </a></h2>

<a name="enames">It's often useful to be able to say an enum is not
in any of its <i>valid</i> states. Make a label for
an uninitialized or error state. Make it the first label
if possible.

</a><h3><a name="enames"> Example </a></h3>
<pre><a name="enames">enum { STATE_ERR,  STATE_OPEN, STATE_RUNNING, STATE_DYING};

<h1> C Function Names </h1>

<ul>
<li> In a C++ project there should be very few C functions.

</a><h1><a name="fext"> C++ File Extensions </a></h1>

<a name="fext">In short: Use the <i>.h</i> extension for header files and <i>.cc</i> for source files. </a><p>

<a name="fext">For some reason an odd split occurred in early C++ compilers around what
C++ source files should be called. C header files always use the <i>.h</i> 
and C source files always use the <i>.c</i> extension. What should we use
for C++? </a></p><p>

<a name="fext">The short answer is as long as everyone on your project agrees it doesn't really 
matter. The build environment should be able to invoke the right compiler for
any extension. Historically speaking here have been the options:
</a></p><ul>
<li><a name="fext"> Header Files: .h, .hh, .hpp
</a></li><li><a name="fext"> Source Files: .C, .cpp, .cc
</a></li></ul>

<h2><a name="fext"> Header File Extension Discussion </a></h2>

<a name="fext">Using <i>.hh</i> extension is not widely popular but makes a certain kind
of sense. C header files use <i>.h</i> file extension and C++ based
header files use <i>.hh</i> file extension. The problem is if we consider 
a header file an </a><a href="#callc"> interface </a> to a service then we can 
have a C interface to a service and C++ interface to the service in the same file. 
Using preprocessor directives this is possible and common. The recommendation is 
to stick with using the <i>.h</i> extension.
<p>

</p><h2> Source File Extension Discussion </h2>

The problem with the <i>.C</i> extension is that it is indistinguishable from
the <i>.c</i> extensions in operating systems that aren't case sensitive. Yes,
this is a UNIX vs. windows issue. Since it is a simple step aiding portability
we won't use the <i>.C</i> extension. The <i>.cpp</i> extension is a little wordy.
So the <i>.cc</i> extension wins by default.

</a><h1><a name="cstas"> Comments Should Tell a Story </a></h1>

<a name="cstas">Consider your comments a story describing the system. Expect
your comments to be extracted by a robot and formed into
a man page. Class comments are one part of the story,
method signature comments are another part of the story,
method arguments another part, and method implementation
yet another part. All these parts should weave together
and inform someone else at another point of time just
exactly what you did and why.


</a><p></p><hr><a name="cdd"></a>
<h1> Document Decisions </h1>

Comments should document decisions. At every point
where you had a choice of what to do place a comment
describing which choice you made and why. Archeologists
will find this the most useful information.


<p></p><hr><a name="cuh"></a>
<h1> Use Extractable Headers </h1>

Use a document extraction system like <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">Doxygen</a>
when documenting your code.
<p>

These headers are structured in such a way as they
can be parsed and extracted. They are not useless
like normal headers. So take time to fill them out.
If you do it right once no more documentation may be
necessary.
</p><p>

As part of your nighlty build system have a step that generates the documentation from the
source. Then index the source using a tool like Lucene. Have a front end to the search
so developers can do full text searches on nightly builds and for release builds.
This is a wonderfully useful feature.

The next step in automation is to front the repository with a web server documentation can 
directly refer to a source file with a URL.

<h1> Comment All Questions a Programmer May Have When Looking at Your Code </h1>

At every point in your code think about what questions a programmer may have about
the code. It's crucial you answer all those questions somehow, someway. If you
don't, as the code writer, answer those questions, who will?
<p>

If you think your code is so clear and wonderful that nobody will have any questions
then you are lying to yourself. I have never seen a large system with this wonderful
self-documenting code feature. I've seen very few small libraries are even a single
class that are so wonderfully self-documented.
</p><p>

You have a lot of tools at your disposal to answer questions:
</p><ol>
<li> A brain to think up the questions you should be answering. Why? Who? When? How?
What?
</li><li> Variable names.
</li><li> Class names.
</li><li> Class decomposition.
</li><li> Method decomposition.
</li><li> File names.
</li><li> Documentation at all levels: package, class, method, attribute, inline.
</li></ol>

The better you are at orchestrating all these elements together the clearer your
code will be to everyone else.
<p>

I don't really consider unit tests a question answering device because if you can't
understand the code by reading it, reading something else about the code you don't
understand won't help you understand it better.

<h1> Make Your Code Discoverable by Browsing </h1>

Programmers should be able to navigate your code by looking at markers in the code, 
namely the names and the directory structure. Nothing is more frustrating to than
to have to look at pile of code and have no idea what it's organizing principles are.
<p>

<b>Have a logicanl directory structure</b>. Have directories called doc, lib, src, bin, test, pkg, 
install, etc and whatever, so I at least have some idea where stuff is. People use the weirdest
names and lump everything together so that it it can be detangles. Clear thought is evidenced
from the beginning by a directory stucture.
</p><p>

<b>Don't put more than one class in a file</b>. Otherwise, how will I know its there when I browse your
code? Should I really need to use search to find every last thing? Can't I just poke around the
code and find it? I can if you organize your code.
</p><p>

<b>Name your files after your classes</b>. I didn't believe this one until I saw it. Why you name
a file different than the class? How I am possibly supposed to know what's in the file otherwise?
</p><p>


</p><p></p><hr><a name="wcyc"></a>
<h1> Write Comments as You Code </h1>

You won't every go back later and document your code. You just won't. Don't lie to yourself, the world,
and your mother by saying that you will.
<p>

So when you do something document it right then and there. When you create a class- document it. When
you create a method- document it. And so on. That way when you finish coding you will also be finished
documenting.
</p><p>

I advocate simultaneously writing code, writing tests, and writing documentaiton.
Which comes first depends on you and the problem. I don't think there is any rule that says
which should come first. On the path to getting stuff done I'll take the entrance that seems 
easiest to me at the time. Once on the path it's easy to follow the entire trail.
</p><p>

Won't this break the flow? No, I think it improves flow because it keeps you <b>mindful</b> of what 
you are doing, why you are doing, and how it fits in the big picture. My take on TDD (test driven
development) is that it's not the tests that are really important, it's that the tests keep you
<b>mindful</b> while programming. A test means you are keeping everything in you mind at once you
need to remember to successfully code something up. As you can't keep large chunks in your mind
then smaller chunks are better. Writing a test forces you to remember what your code is supposed
to accomplish. It's forcing you to also think about the use case/story/intent behind why
you are writing the code.
</p><p>

The result is a pointed mind that has focussed all its powers on doing one thing. When you can
bring that focus to you programming you can be successful. The tests are really secondary. If
your system/acceptance tests can't find bugs you are screwed anyway. And I find code written
mindfully, one step at a time, has very few bugs. 

Unit tests are just one definition of a "step." You can use the orignial story you are implementing
as a step as well. I use unit tests more as a mental focussing device while developing, like Zen
Archery, than for the actual tests. After development unit tests are very useful in making sure
code doesn't break. So I am not saying unit tests aren't useful. I just don't think they are the
real reason behind why TDD generates working code. With a clear well functioning focussed mind
we generate working code. But getting into that state is hard.
</p><p>

Writing comments simultaneously with all other aspects of development deepens your mindfulness
because you are thinking about everything at once. All the interconnections are present in your
brain because you are explaining the intent behind what you are doing. 
</p><p>

There's a saying that you don't know something until you teach it. Comments are teaching what you 
are doing to someone else. When you are writing comments you must generate the thoughts to
teach, to explain to someone else the intent behing what you are doing. It's very difficult
to make a coding error when all this context is hot in your mind.
</p><p>

I'll go back and forth between documenting, testing, and coding. I'll let the problem dictate
what happens when as I am working my way through solving the problem. Saying testing should
always come first is too simple a rule and I think misses the larger point about software
development.
</p><p>

Software is ultimately mind stuff. Using our minds better is the real methodology.
</p><p>

<h1> Make Gotchas Explicit </h1>

Explicitly comment variables changed out of the normal control
flow or other code likely to break during maintenance. Embedded
keywords are used to point out issues and potential problems. Consider a robot 
will parse your comments looking for keywords, stripping them out, and making
a report so people can make a special effort where needed.
<p>

</p><h3> Gotcha Keywords </h3>
     
<ul>
<li> <b>:TODO: topic</b><br> Means there's more to do here, don't forget. <p>

</p></li><li> <b>:BUG: [bugid] topic</b><br> means there's a 
     Known bug here, explain it and optionally give a bug ID. <p>

</p></li><li> <b>:KLUDGE:</b><br> When you've done something ugly say so and explain
     how you would do it differently next time if you had more time. <p>

</p></li><li> <b>:TRICKY:</b><br> Tells somebody that the following code is very tricky
     so don't go changing it without thinking. <p>

</p></li><li> <b>:WARNING:</b><br> Beware of something. <p>

</p></li><li> <b>:COMPILER:</b><br> Sometimes you need to work around a compiler
     problem. Document it. The problem may go away eventually. <p>

</p></li><li> <b>:ATTRIBUTE: value</b><br> The general form of an attribute embedded in
     a comment. You can make up your own attributes and they'll be
     extracted. <p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>

</p><h3> Gotcha Formatting </h3>

<ul>
<li> Make the gotcha keyword the first symbol in the comment.
</li><li> Comments may consist of multiple lines, but the first line
     should be a self-containing, meaningful summary.
</li><li> The writer's name and the date of the remark should be part
     of the comment. This information is in the source repository, but
     it can take a quite a while to find out when and by whom it was
     added. Often gotchas stick around longer than they should.
     Embedding date information allows other programmer to make this
     decision. Embedding who information lets us know who to ask.
</li></ul>


<h3> Example </h3>
<pre>   // :TODO: tmh 960810: possible performance problem
   // We should really use a hash table here but for now we'll
   // use a linear search.

   // :KLUDGE: tmh 960810: possible unsafe type cast
   // We need a cast here to recover the derived type. It should
   // probably use a virtual method or template.
</pre>

See <a href="#two"> Interface and Implementation Documentation </a> 
for more details on how documentation should be laid out.


<p></p><hr><a name="two"></a>
<h1> Interface and Implementation Documentation </h1>

There are two main audiences for documentation:
<ul>
<li> Class Users
</li><li> Class Implementors
</li></ul>

With a little forethought we can extract both types of
documentation directly from source code.

<h2> Class Users </h2>

Class users need class interface information which when structured
correctly can be extracted directly from  a header file. When
filling out the header comment blocks for a class, only
include information needed by programmers who use the class.
Don't delve into algorithm implementation details unless the
details are needed by a user of the class. Consider comments
in a header file a man page in waiting.

<h2> Class Implementors </h2>

Class implementors require in-depth knowledge of how a class
is implemented. This comment type is found in
the source file(s) implementing a class. Don't worry about
interface issues. Header comment blocks in a source file should 
cover algorithm issues and other design decisions. Comment blocks 
within a method's implementation should explain even more.


<p></p><hr><a name="dirdoc"></a>
<h1> Directory Documentation </h1>

Every directory should have a README file that covers:
<ul>
<li> the purpose of the directory and what it contains
</li><li> a one line comment on each file. A comment can
     usually be extracted from the NAME attribute of the
     file header.
</li><li> cover build and install directions
</li><li> direct people to related resources:
     <ul>
     <li> directories of source
     </li><li> online documentation
     </li><li> paper documentation
     </li><li> design documentation
     </li></ul>
</li><li> anything else that might help someone
</li></ul>

Consider a new person coming in 6 months after every
original person on a project has gone. That lone scared
explorer should be able to piece together a picture of the
whole project by traversing a source directory tree and
reading README files, Makefiles, and source file headers.


<p></p><hr><a name="idoc"></a>
<h1> Include Statement Documentation </h1>

Include statements should be documented, telling the user why a
particular file was included. If the file includes a class
used by the class then it's useful to specify a class relationship:
<ul>
<li> ISA - this class inherits from the class in the include file.
</li><li> HASA - this class contains, that is has as a member attribute,
     the class in the include file. This class owns the memory and
     is responsible for deleting it.
</li><li> USES - this class uses something from the include file.
</li><li> HASA-USES - this class keeps a pointer or reference to the
     class in the include file, but this class does not own the
     memory.
</li></ul>

<h3> Example </h3>
<pre>
#ifndef XX_h
#define XX_h

// SYSTEM INCLUDES
//
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;                       // standard IO interface
#include &lt;string.h&gt;                      // HASA string interface
#include &lt;memory&gt;                        // USES auto_ptr

</pre>

Notice how just by reading the include directives the code is starting
to tell you a story of why and how it was built.



<p></p><hr><a name="blockdoc"></a>
<h1> Block Comments </h1>

Use comments on starting and ending a Block:
<pre>{  
   // Block1  (meaningful comment about Block1)
  ... some code

  {  
     // Block2  (meaningful comment about Block2)
     ... some code
  }  // End Block2

}  // End Block1
</pre>

This may make block matching much easier to spot when you
don't have an intelligent editor.

</a><h1><a name="comman"> Complexity Management </a></h1>


<p></p><hr><a name="layering"></a>
<h1> Layering </h1>

Layering is the primary technique for reducing complexity in
a system. A system should be divided into layers. Layers
should communicate between adjacent layers using well defined 
interfaces. When a layer uses a non-adjacent layer then a 
layering violation has occurred.
<p>

A layering violation simply means we have dependency between
layers that is not controlled by a well defined interface.
When one of the layers changes code could break. We don't
want code to break so we want layers to work only with
other adjacent layers.
</p><p>

Sometimes we need to jump layers for performance reasons.
This is fine, but we should know we are doing it and document
appropriately.
</p><p>


</p><p></p><hr><a name="abstract"></a>
<h1> Minimize Dependencies with Abstract Base Classes </h1>

One of the most important strategies in C++ is to remove dependencies
among different subsystems. Abstract base classes (ABCs) are
a solid technique for dependency removal.
<p>

An ABC is an abstraction of a common form such that it can be
used to build more specific forms. An ABC is a common interface
that is reusable across a broad range of similar classes.
By specifying a common interface as long as a class conforming
to that interface is used it doesn't really matter what is the type
of the derived type. This breaks code dependencies. New classes,
conforming to the interface, can be substituted in at will without 
breaking code. In C++ interfaces are specified by using base classes
with virtual methods.
</p><p>

The above is a bit rambling because it's a hard idea to
convey. So let's use an example: We are doing a GUI
where things jump around on the screen. One approach
is to do something like:
</p><pre>   class Frog
   {
   public:
      void Jump();
   }
   class Bean
   {
   public:
      void Jump();
   }
</pre>

The GUI folks could instantiate each object and call the Jump
method of each object. The Jump method of each object contains
the implementation of jumping behavior for that type of object.
Obviously frogs and beans jump differently even though both
can jump.
<p>

Unfortunately the owner of Bean didn't like the word
Jump so they changed the method name to Leap. This broke the
code in the GUI and one whole week was lost.
</p><p>

Then someone wanted to see a horse jump so a Horse class was added:
</p><pre>   class Horse
   {
   public:
      void Jump();
   }
</pre>

The GUI people had to change their code again to add Horse.
<p>

Then someone updated Horse so that its Jump behavior was slightly different.
Unfortunately this caused a total recompile of the GUI code and they
were pissed.
</p><p>

<a name="jumpable"></a>
Someone got the bright idea of trying to remove all the above
dependencies using abstract base classes. They made one base
class that specified an interface for jumping things:
</p><pre>   class Jumpable
   {
   public:
      virtual void Jump() = 0;
   }
</pre>

Jumpable is a base class because other classes need to derive
from it so they can get Jumpable's interface. It's an
abstract base class because one or more of its methods has 
the <i>= 0</i> notation which means the method is a 
<i>pure virtual method</i>. Pure virtual methods
<b>must</b> be implemented by derived classes. The compiler
checks.
<p>

Not all methods in an ABC must be pure virtual, some may have an
implementation. This is especially true when creating a base class 
encapsulating a process common to a lot of objects.
For example, devices that must be opened, diagnostics run, booted,
executed, and then closed on a certain event may create an ABC
called Device that has a method called LifeCycle which calls all other
methods in turn thus running through all phases of a device's life. 
Each device phase would have a pure virtual method in the base class
requiring implementation by more specific devices. This way
the process of using a device is made common but the specifics
of a device are hidden behind a common interface.
</p><p>

Back to Jumpable. All the classes were changed to derive
from Jumpable:
</p><pre>   class Frog : public Jumpable
   {
   public:
      virtual void Jump() { ... }
   }

   etc ...
</pre>

We see an immediate benefit: we know all classes derived from
Jumpable <b>must</b> have a Jump method. No one can go changing
the name to Leap without the compiler complaining. One dependency
broken.
<p>

Another benefit is that we can pass Jumpable objects
to the GUI, not specific objects like Horse or Frog:
</p><pre>   class Gui
   {
   public:
      void MakeJump(Jumpable*);
   }

   Gui gui;
   Frog* pFrog= new Frog;
  
   gui.MakeJump(pFrog); 
</pre>

Notice Gui doesn't even know it's making a frog jump, it
just has a jumpable thing, that's all it cares about. When
Gui calls the Jump method it will get the implementation
for Frog's Jump method. Another dependency down. Gui
doesn't have to know what kind of objects are jumping.
<p>

We also removed the recompile dependency.
Because Gui doesn't contain any Frog objects it will not
be recompiled when Frog changes.


</p><h2> Downside </h2>

Wow! Great stuff! Yes but there are a few downsides:

<h3> Overhead for Virtual Methods </h3>

Virtual methods have a space and time penalty. It's not huge,
but should be considered in design.

<h3> Make Everything an ABC! </h3>

Sometimes people overdo it, making everything an ABC.
The rule is make an ABC when you need one not when you
might need one. It takes effort to design a good ABC,
throwing in a virtual method doesn't an ABC make. Pick
and choose your spots. When some process or
some interface can be reused and people will actually
make use of the reuse then make an ABC and don't look back.



<p></p><hr><a name="liskov"></a>
<h1> Liskov's Substitution Principle (LSP) </h1>

This principle states:
<pre>   All classes derived from a base class should be interchangeable
   when used as a base class.
</pre>

The idea is users of a class should be able to count on similar
behavior from all classes that derive from a base class. No
special code should be necessary to qualify an object before
using it. If you think about it violating LSP is also violating
the <a href="#open"> Open/Closed </a> principle because the code
would have to be modified every time a derived class was added.
It's also related to dependency management using 
<a href="#abstract">abstract base classes</a>.
<p>

For example, if the <a href="#jumpable"> Jump method </a> of a
Frog object implementing the Jumpable interface actually makes 
a call and orders pizza we can say its implementation is not in the 
spirit of Jump and probably all other objects implementing Jump.
Before calling a Jump method a programmer would now have to check 
for the Frog type so it wouldn't screw up the system. We don't
want this in programs. We want to use base classes and feel
comfortable we will get consistent behaviour.
</p><p>

LSP is a very restrictive idea. It constrains implementors quite
a bit. In general people support LSP and have LSP as a goal.


</p><p></p><hr><a name="open"></a>
<h1> Open/Closed Principle </h1>

The Open/Closed principle states a class must be open and
closed where:
<ul>
<li> open means a class has the ability to be extended.
</li><li> closed means a class is closed for modifications other than extension.
     The idea is once a class has been approved for use having gone
     through code reviews, unit tests, and other qualifying
     procedures, you don't want to change the class very much, just extend it.
</li></ul>

The Open/Closed principle is a pitch for stability. A system is extended by adding
new code not by changing already working code. Programmers often don't feel
comfortable changing old code because it works! This principle just gives
you an academic sounding justification for your fears :-)
<p>

In practice the Open/Closed principle simply means making good use of our
old friends abstraction and polymorphism. Abstraction to factor out common
processes and ideas. Inheritance to create an interface that must be adhered
to by derived classes. In C++ we are talking about using 
<a href="#abstract"> abstract base classes </a>. A lot.


</p><p></p><hr><a name="register"></a>
<h1> Register/Dispatch Idiom </h1>

Another strategy for reducing dependencies in a system is
the Register/Dispatch Idiom (RDI). RDI treats large
grained occurrences in a system as events. Events are identified
by some unique identifier. Objects in the system register with
a dispatch system for events or classes of events it is interested
in. Objects that are event sources send events into the dispatch
system so the dispatch system can route events to consumers.
<p>

RDI separates producers and consumers on a distributed scale.
Event producers and consumers don't have to know about each
other at all. Consumers can drop out of the event stream
by deregistering for events. New consumers can register
for events at anytime. Event producers can drop out with
no ill effect to event consumers, the consumer just won't
get any more events. It is a good idea for producers to have
an "I'm going down event" so consumers can react intelligently.
</p><p>

Logically the dispatch system is a central entity. The implementation
however can be quite different. For a highly distributed system
a truly centralized event dispatcher would be a performance bottleneck 
and a single point of failure. Think of event dispatchers as being
a lot of different processes cast about on various machines for redundancy
purposes. Event processors communicate amongst each other to distribute
knowledge about event consumers and producers. Much like a routing
protocol distributes routing information to its peers.
</p><p>

RDI works equally well in the small, in processes and single workstations.
Parts of the system can register as event consumers and event producers
making for a very flexible system. Complex decisions in a system are expressed
as event registrations and deregistrations. No further level of cooperation
required.
</p><p>

More expressive event filters can also be used. The above proposal filters
events on some unique ID. Often you want events filtered on more complex
criteria, much like a database query. For this to work the system has to
understand all data formats. This is easy if you use a common format like
attribute value pairs. Otherwise each filter needs code understanding
packet formats. Compiling in filter code to each dispatcher is one approach.
Creating a downloadable generic stack based filter language has been used with
success on other projects, being both simple and efficient. </p><p> 



</p><p></p><hr><a name="delegation"></a>
<h1> Delegation </h1>

Delegation is the idea of a method using another object's
method to do the real work. In some sense the top layer method
is <i>a front</i> for the other method. Delegation is a form
of dependency breaking. The top layer method never has to
change while it's implementation can change at will.
<p>

Delegation is an alternative to using inheritance for 
implementation purposes. One can use inheritance
to define an interface and delegation to implement
the interface.
</p><p>

Some people feel delegation is a more robust form
of OO than using implementation inheritance. Delegation
encourages the formation of abstract class interfaces
and HASA relationships. Both of which encourage reuse
and dependency breaking.

</p><h2> Example </h2>
<pre>   class TestTaker
   {
   public:
      void WriteDownAnswer()   { mPaidTestTaker.WriteDownAnswer(); } 
   private:
      PaidTestTaker  mPaidTestTaker;
   }
</pre>

In this example a test taker delegates actually answering the
question to a paid test taker. Not ethical but a definite
example of delegation!
<p>



</p><p></p><hr><a name="demeter"></a>
<h1> Follow the Law of Demeter </h1>

The <i>Law of Demeter</i> states (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter">Wikipedia</a>):<i>
An object A can request a service (call a method) of an object instance B, 
but object A cannot &#8220;reach through&#8221; object B to access yet another object 
to request its services. Doing so would mean that object A implicitly requires 
greater knowledge of object B&#8217;s internal structure. Instead, B&#8217;s class should 
be modified if necessary so that object A can simply make the request directly 
of object B, and then let object B propagate the request to any relevant 
subcomponents. If the law is followed, only object B knows its internal structure.</i>

<h2> Justification </h2>

The purpose of this law is to break dependencies
so implementations can change without breaking code.
If an object wishes to remove one of its contained objects
it won't be able to do so because some other object is using it.
If instead the service was through an interface the object
could change its implementation anytime without ill effect.

<h2> Caveat </h2>

As for most laws the Law of Demeter should be ignored in
certain cases. If you have a really high level object
that contains a lot of subobjects, like a car contains
thousands of parts, it can get absurd to created a method
in car for every access to a subobject.

<h2> Example </h2>
<pre>   class SunWorkstation
   {
   public:
      void          UpVolume(int amount) { mSound.Up(amount); }

      SoundCard     mSound;

   private:
      GraphicsCard  mGraphics;
   }

   SunWorksation sun;

   Do   : sun.UpVolume(1);
   Don't: sun.mSound.Up(1);

</pre>



<p></p><hr><a name="contract"></a>
<h1> Design by Contract </h1>

The idea of design by contract is strongly related to <a href="#liskov"> LSP </a>.
A contract is a formal statement of what to expect from another party. In this case
the contract is between pieces of code. An object and/or method states that it does
X and you are supposed to believe it. For example, when you ask an object for its
volume that's what you should get. And because volume is a verifiable attribute
of a thing you could run a series of checks to verify volume is correct, that is,
it satisfies its contract.
<p>

The contract is enforced in languages like
Eiffel by pre and post condition statements that are actually part of the language.
In other languages a bit of faith is needed.
</p><p>

Design by contract when coupled with language based verification mechanisms
is a very powerful idea. It makes programming more like assembling spec'd parts.


</p><h2> Using Design by Contract </h2>

<ol>
<li>
<b>DO NOT PUT "REAL" CODE IN DBC CALLS.</b>. Dbc calls should
only test conditions. No code that can't be compiled out should
be included in Dbc calls.

</li><li> 
Every method should define its pre and post conditions.

</li><li> 
Every class should define its invariants. 

</li><li> 
Callers are responsible for checking preconditions.
An object may not and is not required to test for assertion violations.

</li><li>

<h2> Required Methods Placeholders </h2>

The template has placeholders for <a href="#req"> required methods </a>.
You can delete them or implement them.


<h2> Ordering is: public, protected, private </h2>

Notice that the public interface is placed first in the class, protected next,
and private last. The reasons are:
<ul>
<li> programmers should care about a class's interface more than implementation
</li><li> when programmers need to use a class they need the interface not the 
     implementation
</li></ul>

It makes sense then to have the interface first. Placing implementation, 
the private section, first is a historical accident as the first examples 
used the private first layout. Over time emphasis has switched deemphasizing 
a class's interface over implementation details.

<h2> LIFECYCLE </h2>

The life cycle section is for methods that control the life cycle of an 
object. Typically these methods include constructors, destructors, and 
state machine methods.

<h2> OPERATORS </h2>

Place all operators in this section.

<h2> OPERATIONS </h2>

Place the bulk of a class's non access and inquiry method methods here. 
A programmer will look here for the meat of a class's interface.

<h2> ACCESS </h2>

Place attribute accessors here.

<h2> INQUIRY </h2>

These are the <i>Is*</i> methods. Whenever you have a question to ask about
an object it can be asked via in <i>Is</i> method. For example: IsOpen()
will indicate if the object is open. A good strategy is instead of making
a lot of access methods you can turn them around to be questions about the
object thus reducing the exposure of internal structure. Without the IsOpen()
method we might have had to do: if (STATE_OPEN == State()) which is much uglier.

</a><h1><a name="pubpropri"> What should go in public/protected/private? </a></h1>

<h2><a name="pubpropri"> Public Section </a></h2>

<a name="pubpropri">Only put an object's interface in the public section. <b>DO NOT</b> expose
any private data items in the public section. At least encapsulate
access via access methods. Ideally your method interface should make most
access methods unnecessary. Do not put data in the public interface.

</a><h2><a name="pubpropri"> Protected and Private Section </a></h2>

<a name="pubpropri">What should go into the protected section versus the private section is
always a matter of debate. 

</a><h3><a name="pubpropri"> All Protected </a></h3>

<a name="pubpropri">Some say there should be no private section
and everything not in the public section should go in the protected section.
After all, we should allow all our children to change anything they wish.
</a><p>

</p><h3><a name="pubpropri"> All Private </a></h3>

<a name="pubpropri">Another camp says by making the public interface virtual any derived
class can change behavior without mucking with internals.
</a><p>

</p><h3><a name="pubpropri"> Wishy Washy </a></h3>

<a name="pubpropri">Rationally decide where elements should go and put them there. Not
very helpful.

</a><h3><a name="pubpropri"> And the Winner Is... </a></h3>

<a name="pubpropri">Keeping everything all private seems the easiest approach. By
making the public methods virtual flexibility is preserved.

<a name="req">To be good citizens almost all classes should implement

the "required" methods they should still be represented in your class 
definition as comments. 

</a><ul>

<a name="req">If your class needs a constructor, make sure to provide one.
You need one if during the operation of the class it creates
something or does something that needs to be undone when the
object dies. This includes creating memory, opening file descriptors,
opening transactions etc.

<a name="req">If the default constructor is sufficient add a comment indicating that 
the compiler-generated version will be used.

<a name="req">If your default constructor has one or more optional arguments, add a
comment indicating that it still functions as the default constructor.
</a></p><p>

</p></li><li><a name="req"> <b>Virtual Destructor</b></a><p>

<a name="req">If your class is intended to be derived from by other classes then make the 
destructor virtual.
</a></p><p>

</p></li><li><a name="req"> <b>Copy Constructor</b></a><p>

<a name="req">If your class is copyable, either define a copy constructor and
assignment operator or add a comment indicating that the
compiler-generated versions will be used. 
</a></p><p>

<a name="req">If your class objects should not be copied, make the copy constructor
and assignment operator private and don't define bodies for them.  If
you don't know whether the class objects should be copyable, then assume
not unless and until the copy operations are needed. 
</a></p><p>

</p></li><li><a name="req"> <b>Assignment Operator</b></a><p>

</a><h1><a name="mlayout"> Method Layout </a></h1>

<a name="mlayout">The approach used is to place a comment block before each method that
can be extracted by a tool and be made part of the class documentation.
Here we'll use </a><a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">Doxygen</a> 
which supports the Javadoc format. See the Doxygen documentation for
a list of attributes supported by the document generator. 
<p>

</p><h3> Method Header </h3>

Every parameter should be documented. Every return code should
be documented. All exceptions should be documented.
Use complete sentences when describing attributes.
Make sure to think about what other resources developers
may need and encode them in with the @see attributes.

<pre>  /** Assignment operator.
   * 
   *
   * @param val The value to assign to this object.
   * @exception LibaryException The explanation for the exception.
   * @return A reference to this object.
   */
   XX&amp;                     operator=(XX&amp; val);
</pre>


<h3> Additional Sections </h3>

In addition to the standard attribute set, the following
sections can be included in the documentation:

<ol>
<li> <b> PRECONDITION</b><br>

Document what must have happened for the object to be in a state
where the method can be called.
<p>

</p></li><li> <b> WARNING</b><br>

Document anything unusual users should know about this method.
<p>

</p></li><li> <b> LOCK REQUIRED</b><br>

Some methods require a semaphore be acquired before using the method. When
this is the case use lock required and specify the name of the lock.
<p>

</p></li><li> <b> EXAMPLES </b><br>

Include exampes of how to use a method. A picture says a 1000 words,
a good example answers a 1000 questions.
<p>
</p></li></ol>

For example:
<pre>  /** Copy one string to another.
   *
   * <b>PRECONDITION</b><br>
   * REQUIRE(from != 0)
   * REQUIRE(to != 0)
   *
   * <b>WARNING</b><br>
   * The <b>to</b> buffer must be long enough to hold
   * the entire <b>from</b> buffer.
   *
   * <b>EXAMPLES</b><br>
   * <pre>   * strcpy(somebuf, "test")
   * </pre>
   *
   * @param from The string to copy.
   * @param to The buffer to copy the string to.
   *
   * @return void
   */
   void  strcpy(const char* from, char* to); 
</pre>
<p>

</p><h3> Common Exception Sections </h3>

If the same exceptions are being used in a number of
methods, then the exceptions can be documented once
in the class header and referred to from the method
documentation.

<h1> Formatting Methods with Multiple Arguments </h1>

We should try and make methods have as few parameters as possible. If you find yourself
passing the same variables to every method then that variable should probably be
part of the class. When a method does have a lot of parameters format it 
like this:

<pre>   int                     AnyMethod(
                              int   arg1,  
                              int   arg2, 
                              int   arg3,
                              int   arg4);
</pre>



<p></p><hr><a name="accessor">
</a><h1><a name="accessor"> Different Accessor Styles </a></h1>

<h2><a name="accessor"> Why Accessors? </a></h2>

<a name="accessor">Access methods provide access to the physical or logical attributes of 
an object. Accessing an object's attributes directly as we do for C 
structures is greatly discouraged in C++. We disallow direct access 
to attributes to break dependencies, the reason we do most things. 
Directly accessing an attribute exposes implementation details about 
the object. 
</a><p>

<a name="accessor">To see why ask yourself:
</a></p><ul>
<li><a name="accessor"> What if the object decided to provide the attribute in a 
     way other than physical containment? 
</a></li><li><a name="accessor"> What if it had to do a database lookup for the attribute? 
</a></li><li><a name="accessor"> What if a different object now contained the attribute?
</a></li></ul>

<a name="accessor">If any of the above changed code would break. An object makes
a contract with the user to provide access to a particular 
attribute; it should not promise how it gets those attributes.
Accessing a physical attribute makes such a promise.

</a><h2><a name="accessor"> Accessors Considered Somewhat Harmful </a></h2>

<a name="accessor">At least in the public interface having accessors many times is an admission
of failure, a failure to make an object's interface complete.
At the protected or private level accessors are fine as these
are the implementation levels of a class.

</a><h2><a name="accessor"> Implementing Accessors </a></h2>

<a name="accessor">There are three major idioms for creating accessors.

</a><h3><a name="accessor"> Get/Set </a></h3>
<pre><a name="accessor">   class X
   {
   public:
      int    GetAge() const     { return mAge; }
      void   SetAge(int age)    { mAge= age; }
   private:
      int mAge;
   }
</a></pre>

<a name="accessor">The problem with Get/Set is twofold:
</a><ul>
<li><a name="accessor"> It's ugly. Get and Set are strewn throughout the code
     cluttering it up.
</a></li><li><a name="accessor"> It doesn't treat attributes as objects in their own right.
     An object will have an assignment operator. Why shouldn't
     age be an object and have its own assignment operator?
</a></li></ul>

<a name="accessor">One benefit, that it shares with the <i>One Method Name</i>, is
when used with messages the set method can transparently transform
from native machine representations to network byte order.


</a><h3><a name="accessor"> One Method Name </a></h3>
<pre><a name="accessor">   class X
   {
   public:
      int    Age() const     { return mAge; }
      void   Age(int age)    { mAge= age; }
   private:
      int mAge;
   }
</a></pre>

<a name="accessor">Similar to Get/Set but cleaner. Use this approach when not
using the <i>Attributes as Objects</i> approach.


</a><h3><a name="accessor"> Attributes as Objects </a></h3>
<pre><a name="accessor">   class X
   {
   public:
      int              Age() const     { return mAge; }
      int&amp;             rAge()          { return mAge; } 

      const String&amp;    Name() const    { return mName; }
      String&amp;          rName()         { return mName; }
   private:
      int              mAge;
      String           mName;
   }
</a></pre>

<a name="accessor">The above two attribute examples shows the strength and weakness
of the Attributes as Objects approach. 
</a><p>

<a name="accessor">When using an int type, which is not a real object, the int is set 
directly because <i>rAge()</i> returns a <b>reference</b>. The object can do 
no checking of the value or do any representation reformatting. For many
simple attributes, however, these are not horrible restrictions. A way
around this problem is to use a class wrapper around base types like
int.
</a></p><p>

<a name="accessor">When an object is returned as reference its <i>=</i> operator is
invoked to complete the assignment. For example:
</a></p><pre><a name="accessor">   X x;
   x.rName()= "test";
</a></pre>

<a name="accessor">This approach is also more consistent with the object philosophy:
the object should do it. An object's <i>=</i> operator can do
all the checks for the assignment and it's done once in one
place, in the object, where it belongs. It's also clean from
a name perspective.
</a><p>

<a name="accessor">When possible use this approach to attribute access.



</a></p><p><a name="accessor"> </a></p><hr><a name="accessor"> </a><a name="init"></a>
<h1> Init Idiom for Initializing Objects </h1> 

<ul>
<li> Objects with multiple constructors and/or multiple attributes
     should define a private <b>Init()</b> method to initialize
     all attributes. If the number of different member variables
	 is small then this idiom may not be a big win and C++'s
	 constructor initialization syntax can/should be used.
</li></ul>

<h2> Justification </h2>

<ul>
<li> When using C++'s ability to initialize variables in the constructor
     it's difficult with multiple constructors and/or multiple
     attributes to make sure all attributes are initialized. When an attribute
     is added or changed almost invariably we'll miss changing a
     constructor.
     <p>

     It's better to define one method, <b>Init()</b>, that initializes
     all possible attributes. Init() should be called first from every
     constructor.
     </p><p>

</p></li><li> The Init() idiom cannot be used in two cases where initialization
     from a constructor is required:
     <ul>
     <li> constructing a member object
     </li><li> initializing a member attribute that is a reference
     </li></ul> 
</li></ul>

<h2> Example </h2>
<pre>   class Test
   {
   public:
      Test()
      {
         Init();   // Call to common object initializer
      }

      Test(int val)
      {
         Init();   // Call to common object initializer
         mVal= val;
      }

   private:
      int      mVal;
      String*  mpName;

      void Init()
      {
         mVal  = 0;
         mpName= 0;
      }
   }

Since the number of member variables is small, this might be better
written as:

   class Test 
   {
   public:
     Test(int val = 0, String* name = 0)
       : mVal(val), mpName(name) {}
   private:
     int         mVal;
     String*     mpName;
   };
</pre>


<p></p><hr><a name="initvar"></a>
<h1> Initialize all Variables </h1> 

<ul>
<li> You shall always initialize variables. Always. Every time.
</li></ul>

<h2> Justification </h2>

<ul>
<li> More problems than you can believe are eventually traced
     back to a pointer or variable left uninitialized. C++
     tends to encourage this by spreading initialization to each constructor.
     See <a href="#init"> Init Idiom for Initializing Objects </a>.
</li></ul>



<p></p><hr><a name="mininlines"></a>
<h1> Minimize Inlines </h1> 

Minimize inlining in declarations or inlining in general. As soon as you 
put your C++ code in a shared library which you want to maintain compatibility 
with in the future, inlined code is a major pain in the butt. It's not worth 
it, for most cases.

</a></li><li><a name="openreasons"> Virtual methods are not available in base classes.

</a></li><li><a name="openreasons"> Larger scale state machines may dictate when initialization should occur.

There is a pattern called <a href="#raii">Resource Acquisition as Initialization</a>

<h1> Thin vs. Thick Class Interfaces </h1>

How many methods should an object have? The right answer of course is just the right amount, we'll call
this the Goldilocks level. But what is the Goldilocks level? It doesn't
exist. You need to make the right judgment for your situation, which is really
what programmers are for :-)
<p>

The two extremes are <b>thin</b> classes versus <b>thick</b> classes. Thin 
classes are minimalist classes. Thin classes have as few methods as possible.
The expectation is users will derive their own class from the thin class adding
any needed methods. 
</p><p>

While thin classes may seem "clean" they really aren't. You can't do much with
a thin class. Its main purpose is setting up a type. Since thin classes have so
little functionality many programmers in a project will create derived classes
with everyone adding basically the same methods. This leads to code duplication
and maintenance problems which is part of the reason we use objects 
in the first place. The obvious solution is to push methods up to the base class. 
Push enough methods up to the base class and you get <b>thick</b> classes.
</p><p>

Thick classes have a lot of methods. If you can think of it a thick class
will have it. Why is this a problem? It may not be. If the methods are directly
related to the class then there's no real problem with the class containing
them. The problem is people get lazy and start adding methods to a class that
are related to the class in some willow wispy way, but would be better factored
out into another class. Judgment comes into play again.
</p><p>

Thick classes have other problems. As classes get larger
they may become harder to understand. They also become harder to debug
as interactions become less predictable. And when a method is changed that
you don't use or care about your code will still have to be recompiled, possibly
retested, and rereleased.

<h1> Use a Design Notation and Process </h1>

Programmers need to have a common language for talking
about coding, designs, and the software process in general.
This is critical to project success. 
<p>

Any project brings together people of widely varying skills,
knowledge, and experience. Even if everyone on a project
is a genius you will still fail because people will
endlessly talk past each other because there is
no common language and processes binding the project together.
All you'll get is massive fights, burnout, and little progress.
If you send your group to training they may not come back seasoned 
experts but at least your group will all be on the same page;
a team.
</p><p>

There are many popular methodologies out there.  The
point is to do some research, pick a method, train
your people on it, and use it. Take a look at the top of
this page for links to various methodologies.

You may find the <b>CRC</b> (class responsibility cards) approach to
teasing out a design useful. Many others have. It is an informal
approach encouraging team cooperation and focusing on
objects doing things rather than objects having attributes. There's
even a whole book on it: Using CRC Cards by Nancy M. Wilkinson.

</a><h1><a name="usecases"> Using Use Cases </a></h1>

<a name="usecases">A <i>use case</i> is a generic description of an entire transaction
involving several objects. A use case can also describe the behaviour
of a set of objects, such as an organization. A use case model thus
presents a collection of use cases and is typically used to specify
the behavior of a whole application system together with one or more
external actors that interact with the system.
</a><p>

<a name="usecases">An individual use case may have a name (although it is typically
not a simple name). Its meaning is often written as an informal text
description of the external actors and the sequences of events
between objects that make up the transaction. Use cases can
include other use cases as part of their behaviour.

</a></p><h2><a name="usecases"> Requirements Capture </a></h2>

<a name="usecases">Use cases attempt to capture the requirements for a system in
an understandable form. The idea is by running through a set
of use case we can verify that the system is doing what it 
should be doing.

<a name="stories">It seems we need something more detailed than
requirements as requirements tend to be fairly high level and are

<h1> Code Reviews </h1>

If you can make a formal code review work then my hat is off
to you. Code reviews can be very useful. Unfortunately they
often degrade into nit picking sessions and endless arguments
about silly things. They also tend to take a lot of people's
time for a questionable payback.
<p>

My god he's questioning code reviews, he's not an engineer!
</p><p>

Not really, it's the form of code reviews and how they fit into
normally late chaotic projects is what is being questioned.
</p><p>

First, code reviews are <b>way too late</b> to do much of
anything useful. What needs reviewing are requirements and
design. This is where you will get more bang for the buck.
</p><p>

Get all relevant people in a room. Lock them in. Go over the class design
and requirements until the former is good and the latter is being met. 
Having all the relevant people in the room makes this process
a deep fruitful one as questions can be immediately answered and
issues immediately explored. Usually only a couple of such meetings
are necessary.
</p><p>

If the above process is done well coding will take
care of itself. If you find problems in the code
review the best you can usually do is a rewrite after someone has sunk
a ton of time and effort into making the code "work."
</p><p>

You will still want to do a code review, just do it offline. Have a 
couple people you trust read the code in question and simply make
comments to the programmer. Then the programmer and reviewers
can discuss issues and work them out. Email and quick pointed 
discussions work well. This approach meets the goals
and doesn't take the time of 6 people to do it. </p><p>

You'll find a lot of information on justifying code reviews if you are having
troubles instituting them and lots of suggestions on how to conduct them.

</a><h1><a name="getsome"> Create a Source Code Control System Early and Not Often </a></h1><a name="getsome"> 

A common build system and source code control system should be put in place
as early as possible in a project's lifecycle, preferably before anyone starts
coding. Source code control is the structural glue binding a project together.
If programmers can't easily use each other's products then you'll never be
able to make a good reproducible build and people will piss away a lot of time.
It's also hell converting rogue build environments to a standard system.
But it seems the right of passage for every project to build their own custom 
environment that never quite works right. </a><p>

<a name="getsome">Some issues to keep in mind:
</a></p><ul>
<li><a name="getsome"> Appoint a <i>buildmaster</i> who is in charge of the build environment and making
     builds. If you have a tools group so much the better as build environments
     generally generate a lot of tools.
</a></li><li><a name="getsome"> Programmers should generally leave tagging and other advanced operations
     to the buildmaster.
</a></li><li><a name="getsome"> Shared source environments like CVS usually work best in largish projects.
</a></li><li><a name="getsome"> Makefiles should be completely templated so developers need no makefile 
     expertise.
</a></li><li><a name="getsome"> You will need multiple builds of the same code meaning programmers will
     want to have the option of building against optimized code versions,
     debugger code versions, code with the -DDEBUG macro defined and versions
     without, etc. One way to do this is have everyone check out all code and do
     a total rebuild. The other better way is for the buildmaster to build all
     necessary versions of code so programmers can check out only the code which
     they are modifying. The idea is that each combination of compile flags and
     macros defines a build.
</a></li><li><a name="getsome"> Dependency checking should work!
</a></li><li><a name="getsome"> Maintain a cycle of builds. Create a nightly build so problems can be
     detected early. Create a valid build every week or for every feature set
     that is guaranteed to be good. Every release to QA or to customers should
     be tagged and available in the tree. Official builds should be official because
     they contain a certain set of features that assumably meet a schedule, not
     because it's a certain date.
</a></li><li><a name="getsome"> If you use CVS use a <i>reference tree</i> approach. With this approach a master
     build tree is kept of various builds. Programmers checkout source against the
     build they are working on. They only checkout what they need because the make
     system uses the build for anything not found locally. Using the <i>-I and -L</i>
     flags makes this system easy to setup. Search locally for any files and libraries
     then search in the reference build. This approach saves on disk space and build time.
</a></li><li><a name="getsome"> Get a lot of disk space. With disk space as cheap it is there is no reason not
     to keep plenty of builds around and have enough space for programmers to compile.
</a></li><li><a name="getsome"> Make simple things simple. It should be dead simple and well documented on how to:
     </a><ul>
<a name="getsome">     </a><li><a name="getsome"> check out modules to build
     </a></li><li><a name="getsome"> how to change files
     </a></li><li><a name="getsome"> how to setup makefiles
     </a></li><li><a name="getsome"> how to add new modules into the system
     </a></li><li><a name="getsome"> how to delete modules and files
     </a></li><li><a name="getsome"> how to check in changes
     </a></li><li><a name="getsome"> what are the available libraries and include files
     </a></li><li><a name="getsome"> how to get the build environment including all compilers and other tools
     </a></li></ul><p>

<a name="getsome">     Make a web page or document or whatever. New programmers shouldn't have to go around
     begging for build secrets from the old timers.
</a></p></li><li><a name="getsome"> Use the idea of services. If using a feature requires linking to 3 libraries
     think about making a <i>service</i> specifiable in the makefile programmers can
     use instead of having to know the exact libraries needed. With this approach
     the libraries making up a service can be changed in a based makefile without
     requiring changes in all makefiles.
</a></li><li><a name="getsome"> On checkins log comments should be useful. These comments should be collected every
     night and sent to interested parties.
</a></li></ul>
<a name="getsome">    
</a><h2><a name="getsome"> Source Code Control Systems </a></h2>

<a name="getsome">Some options for source code control systems are:

</p><hr><a name="resp"></a>
<h1> Honor Responsibilities </h1>

Responsibility for software modules is scoped. Modules are either the responsibility of a 
particular person or are common. Honor this division of responsibility. Don't
go changing things that aren't your responsibility to change. Only mistakes
and hard feelings will result. <p>

Face it, if you don't own a piece of code you can't possibly be in a position to 
change it. There's too much context. Assumptions seemingly reasonable to you
may be totally wrong. If you need a change simply ask the responsible person
to change it. Or ask them if it is OK to make such-n-such a change. If they say OK
then go ahead, otherwise holster your editor. </p><p>

Every rule has exceptions. If it's 3 in the morning and you need to make a change
to make a deliverable then you have to do it. If someone is on vacation and no one
has been assigned their module then you have to do it. If you make changes in other
people's code try and use the same style they have adopted. </p><p>

Programmers need to mark with comments code that is particularly sensitive to
change. If code in one area requires changes to code in an another area then
say so. If changing data formats will cause conflicts with persistent stores
or remote message sending then say so. If you are trying to minimize memory
usage or achieve some other end then say so. Not everyone is as brilliant as you. </p><p>

The worst sin is to flit through the system changing bits of code to match your
coding style. If someone isn't coding to the standards then ask them or ask
your manager to ask them to code to the standards. Use common courtesy. </p><p>

Code with common responsibility should be treated with care. Resist making radical 
changes as the conflicts will be hard to resolve. Put comments in the file on how
the file should be extended so everyone will follow the same rules. Try and use
a common structure in all common files so people don't have to guess on where
to find things and how to make changes. Checkin changes as soon as possible so
conflicts don't build up. </p><p>

As an aside, module responsibilities must also be assigned for bug tracking purposes.</p><p>


</p><hr><a name="autocheck"></a>
<h1> Process Automation </h1>

It's a sad fact of human nature that if you don't measure it or check for
it: it won't happen. The implication is you must automate as much of
the development process as possible and provide direct feedback
to developers on specific issues that they can fix.
<p>

Process automation also frees up developers to do real work because they
don't have to babysit builds and other project time sinks.
</p><p>

</p><h2> Automated Builds and Error Assignment </h2>

Create an automated build system that can create nightly builds, parse 
the build errors, assign the errors to developers, and email developers
their particular errors so they can fix them.
<p>

This is the best way to maintain a clean build. Make sure the list
of all errors for a build is available for everyone to see so
everyone can see everyone elses errors. The goal is replace
a blaim culture with a culture that tries to get things right
and fixes them when they are wrong. Immediate feedback makes this
possible.
</p><p>

</p><h2> Automated Code Checking </h2>

As part of the automated build process you can check for coding standard
violations and for other problems. If you don't check for it people 
will naturally do their own thing. Code reviews aren't good enough
to keep the code correct. With a tool like
<a href="http://www.abxsoft.com/codchk.htm">Abraxis Code Check</a> 
you can check the code for a lot of potential problems. 
<p>

This feature like the automated error assignment makes problems immediately
visible and immediately correctable, all without a lot of blame
and shame.

</p><h2> Documentation Extraction </h2>

Related to this principle is the need to automatically extract documentation
from the source code and make it available on line for everyone to use.
If you don't do this documentation will be seen as generally useless and
developers won't put as much effort into it. Making the documentation
visible encourages people to do a better job.


<h2> Connect Source Code Control System and Bug Tracking System </h2>

<ol>
<li>
When a check-in of source code fixes a bug then have the check-in
automatically tell the bug tracking system that the bug was fixed.

</li><li>
When a bug fix is built in a build change the state of the bug to
BUILT.

</li><li>
Have a submit tool where people ask judges of they can submit
a bug fix on the branch.
</li></ol>

There are lots of things you can do depending on how complicated
your environment. The more complicated the environment the more
you should think about connecting all systems together.


<p></p><hr><a name="tools"></a>
<h1> Tools Agreement </h1>

The reality of different tool preferences is something to deal with
explicitly and openly. Tools include IDEs, languages, editors, make program,
source code control, bug system, debuggers, test framework, etc. Some tool
decisions by their nature must be project wide, other decisions
can be customized per developer. 
<p>

A split might also be done by who is performing the build. For example, an 
IDE should be able to used in local builds, but the make program would 
be used for nightly and release builds.
</p><p>

Certain things are easy/trivial/useful  with one tool, but 
hard/complicated/stupid with another tool. Unstated tool assumptions 
can be the source of a lot of confusion. 
"Get a better editor" is not always a workable response, though 
sometimes that's all there is to it!
</p><p>


</p><p></p><hr><a name="sched"></a>
<h1> Non-Blocking Scheduling </h1>

Schedules are lies. Schedules suck. Yes, yes, yes. 
But we still need them. 
<p>

The most effective scheduling rule i've used is to schedule so 
as to unblock others. The idea is to complete the portions of 
a feature that will unblock those dependent on you. This way 
development moves along smoothly because more lines of development 
can be active at a time. For example, instead of implementing 
the entire database, implement the simple interface and stub 
it out. People can work for a very long time this way using 
that portion of the feature that caused others not to block. 
Plus it's a form of rapid prototyping because you get immediate 
feedback on these parts. Don't worry about the quality of 
implementation because it doesn't matter yet.

<h1> Using Personas </h1>

Personas are a powerful design tool, especially when combined with 
responsibility driven design.
<a href="http://66.102.7.104/search?q=cache:sKnbG9wno1kJ:boxesandarrows.com/archives/print/002330.php">
Cooper's personas are:</a>.
<pre>simply pretend users of the system you're building. You describe 
them, in a surprising amount of detail, and then design your 
system for them. 
</pre><p>

I have a standard set of personas that i consider when creating
a design/architecture that don't seem to be common. When you write
code their are a lot of personas looking over your shoulder:
</p><ol>
<li> other programmers using the code
</li><li> maintenance
</li><li> extension
</li><li> documentation group
</li><li> training group
</li><li> code review
</li><li> test and validation
</li><li> manufacturing
</li><li> field support 
</li><li> first and second line technical support
</li><li> live debugging
</li><li> post crash debugging
</li><li> build system (documentation generation and automatic testing)
</li><li> unit testing
</li><li> system testing
</li><li> source code control 
</li><li> code readers
</li><li> legal
</li></ol><p>

You are much more careful and more thorough when you really thing about
all the personas, all the different people and all their 
different roles and purposes.

</a><h1><a name="formatting"> Formatting </a></h1>


<p></p><hr><a name="brace"></a>
<h1> Braces <i>{}</i> Policy </h1>

<h2> Brace Placement </h2>

Of the three major brace placement strategies two are acceptable,
with the first one listed being preferable:

<ul>
<li> Place brace under and inline with keywords:
<pre>   if (condition)        while (condition)
   {                     {
      ...                   ...
   }                     }
</pre>

</li><li> Traditional Unix policy of placing the initial brace on the
     same line as the keyword and the trailing brace inline on its
     own line with the keyword:
<pre>   if (condition) {      while (condition) {
      ...                   ...
   }                     }
</pre>
</li></ul>

<h3> Justification </h3>

<ul>
<li> Another religious issue of great debate solved by compromise.
     Either form is acceptable, many people, however, find the first
     form more pleasant. Why is the topic of many psychological
     studies. <p>

     There are more reasons than psychological for preferring the first style.
     If you use an editor (such as vi) that supports brace matching, the first
     is a much better style.  Why?  Let's say you have a large block of code
     and want to know where the block ends.  You move to the first brace hit
     a key and the editor finds the matching brace.  Example:

</p><pre>     if (very_long_condition &amp;&amp; second_very_long_condition)
     {
        ...
     }
     else if (...)
     {
	..
     }
</pre>

     To move from block to block you just need to use cursor down and your
     brace matching key.  No need to move to the end of the line to match
     a brace then jerk back and forth.

</li></ul>


<h2> When Braces are Needed </h2>

All if, while and do statements must either have braces or be on a single
line. 
<p>

</p><h3> Always Uses Braces Form </h3>

All if, while and do statements require braces even if there is only a
single statement within the braces.  For example:
<pre>if (1 == somevalue)
{
   somevalue = 2;
}
</pre>

<h4> Justification </h4>

It ensures that when someone adds a line of code later there are
already braces and they don't forget. It provides a more consistent look.
This doesn't affect execution speed.  It's easy to do.


<h3> One Line Form </h3>

<pre>if (1 == somevalue) somevalue = 2;
</pre>


<h4> Justification </h4>

It provides safety when adding new lines while maintainng a compact
readable form.


<h2> Add Comments to Closing Braces </h2>

Adding a comment to closing braces can help when you are
reading code because you don't have to find the begin brace
to know what is going on. 

<pre>while(1)
{
   if (valid)
   {
  
   } // if valid
   else
   {
   } // not valid

} // end forever
</pre>


<h2> Consider Screen Size Limits </h2>

Some people like blocks to fit within a common screen size 
so scrolling is not necessary when reading code.


<p></p><hr><a name="indent"></a>
<h1> Indentation/Tabs/Space Policy </h1>

<ul>
<li> Indent using 3, 4, or 8 spaces for each level.
</li><li> Do not use tabs, use spaces. Most editors can substitute
     spaces for tabs.
</li><li> Tabs should be fixed at 8 spaces. Don't set tabs to a different spacing,
     uses spaces instead.
</li><li> Indent as much as needed, but no more. There are no arbitrary
     rules as to the maximum indenting level. If the indenting level
     is more than 4 or 5 levels you may think about factoring out
     code.
</li></ul>

<h2> Justification </h2>

<ul>
<li> Tabs aren't used because 8 space indentation severely limits the number
     of indentation levels one can have. The argument that if this is a problem
     you have too many indentation levels has some force, but real code can
     often be three or more levels deep. Changing a tab to be less than 8 spaces is a problem
     because that setting is usually local. When someone prints the source
     tabs will be 8 characters and the code will look horrible. Same for
     people using other editors. Which is why we use spaces...
</li><li> When people using different tab settings the code is impossible
     to read or print, which is why spaces are preferable to tabs.
</li><li> Nobody can ever agree on the correct number of spaces, just be
     consistent. In general people have found 3 or 4 spaces per indentation
     level workable.
</li><li> As much as people would like to limit the maximum indentation
     levels it never seems to work in general. We'll trust that
     programmers will choose wisely how deep to nest code.
</li></ul>

<h2> Example </h2>
<pre>   void
   func()
   {
      if (something bad)
      {
         if (another thing bad)
         {
            while (more input)
            {
            }
         }
      }
   }
</pre>


<p></p><hr><a name="parens"></a>
<h1> Parens <i>()</i> with Key Words and Functions Policy </h1> 

<ul>
<li> Do not put parens next to keywords. Put a space between.
</li><li> Do put parens next to function names.
</li><li> Do not use parens in return statements when it's not necessary.
</li></ul>

<h2> Justification </h2>

<ul>
<li> Keywords are not functions. By putting parens next to keywords
     keywords and function names are made to look alike.
</li></ul>

<h2> Example </h2>
<pre>
    if (condition)
    {
    }

    while (condition)
    {
    }

    strcpy(s, s1);

    return 1;
</pre>


<p></p><hr><a name="linelen"></a>
<h1> A Line Should Not Exceed 78 Characters </h1> 

<ul>
<li> Lines should not exceed 78 characters.
</li></ul>

<h2> Justification </h2>

<ul>
<li> Even though with big monitors we stretch windows wide
     our printers can only print so wide. And we still need
     to print code.
</li><li> The wider the window the fewer windows we can have on a screen.
     More windows is better than wider windows.
</li><li> We even view and print diff output correctly on all terminals and 
     printers.
</li></ul>



<p></p><hr><a name="ifthen"></a>
<h1> <i>If Then Else</i> Formatting </h1>

<h2> Layout </h2>

It's up to the programmer. Different bracing styles will yield 
slightly different looks. One common approach is:
<pre>   if (condition)                 // Comment
   {
   } 
   else if (condition)            // Comment
   {
   }
   else                           // Comment
   {
   }
</pre>

If you have <i>else if</i> statements then it is usually a good idea
to always have an else block for finding unhandled cases. Maybe put a log
message in the else even if there is no corrective action taken.
<p>

</p><h2> Condition Format </h2>

Always put the constant on the left hand side of an equality/inequality 
comparison. For example: <p>
  
if ( 6 == errorNum ) ... </p><p>

One reason is that if you leave out one of the = signs, the compiler will 
find the error for you.  A second reason is that it puts the value you are 
looking for right up front where you can find it instead of buried at the 
end of your expression.  It takes a little time to get used to this 
format, but then it really gets useful.
</p><p>


</p><p></p><hr><a name="switch">
</a><h1><a name="switch"> <i>switch</i> Formatting </a></h1>

<ul>
<li><a name="switch"> Falling through a case statement into the next case statement
     shall be permitted as long as a comment is included.
</a></li><li><a name="switch"> The <i>default</i> case should always be present and trigger

</a></pre>


<p></p><hr><a name="goto">
</a><h1><a name="goto"> Use of <i>goto,continue,break</i> and <i>?:</i> </a></h1>

<h2><a name="goto"> Goto </a></h2>

<a name="goto">Goto statements should be used sparingly, as in any well-structured code. 
The goto debates are boring so we won't go into them here. The main
place where they can be usefully employed is to break out of several
levels of switch, for, and while nesting, although the need to do such a thing
may indicate that the inner constructs should be broken out into a separate
function, with a success/failure return code.
</a><p>
</p><pre><a name="goto"><tt>
   for (...) 
   {
      while (...) 
      {
         ...
         if (disaster)
            goto error;
      }
   }
   ...
error:
   clean up the mess 
</tt></a></pre>
<p>

<a name="goto">When a goto is necessary the accompanying label should be alone on a line and
to the left of the code that follows. The goto should be
commented (possibly in the block header) as to its utility and purpose.

</a><a name="contbreak"></a>
</p><h2> Continue and Break </h2>

Continue and break are really disguised gotos so they are covered
here.
<p>

Continue and break like goto should be used sparingly as they are magic in
code. With a simple spell the reader is beamed to god knows where for
some usually undocumented reason. 
</p><p>

The two main problems with continue are:
</p><ul>
<li> It may bypass the test condition
</li><li> It may bypass the increment/decrement expression
</li></ul>
<p>
Consider the following example where both problems occur:

</p><pre>while (TRUE) 
{
   ...
   // A lot of code
   ...
   if (/* some condition */) {
      continue;
   }
   ...
   // A lot of code 
   ...
   if ( i++ &gt; STOP_VALUE) break;
}
</pre>

Note: "A lot of code" is necessary in order that the problem cannot be
caught easily by the programmer.
<p>

From the above example, a further rule may be given:
Mixing continue with break in the same loop is a sure way to disaster.
</p><p>

</p><h2> ?: </h2>

The trouble is people usually try and stuff too much code
in between the <i>?</i> and <i>:</i>. Here are a couple of
clarity rules to follow:
<ul>
<li> Put the condition in parens so as to set it off from other code
</li><li> If possible, the actions for the test should be simple functions.
</li><li> Put the action for the then and else statement on a separate line
     unless it can be clearly put on one line.
</li></ul>

<h3> Example </h3>
<pre>   (condition) ? funct1() : func2();

   or

   (condition)
      ? long statement
      : another long statement;
</pre>


<p> </p><hr> <a name="one"></a>
<h1> One Statement Per Line </h1>

There should be only one statement per line unless the statements 
are very closely related.
<p>

The reasons are:
</p><ol>
<li> The code is easier to read. Use some white space too. Nothing better
     than to read code that is one line after another with no white space
     or comments.
</li></ol>

<h2> One Variable Per Line </h2>

Related to this is always define one variable per line:
<pre><b>Not:</b>
char **a, *x;

<b>Do</b>:
char** a= 0;  // add doc
char*  x= 0;  // add doc
</pre>

The reasons are:
<ol>
<li> Documentation can be added for the variable on the line.
</li><li> It's clear that the variables are initialized.
</li><li> Declarations are clear which reduces the probability of declaring a
variable when you actually mean to declare a pointer.

</a></p><h1><a name="coeeal"> Create One Exception for Each Library </a></h1>

<a name="coeeal">Creating very elaborate exception hierarchies is a waste of time. Nobody ends of caring
and all the effort goes to waste. Instead, create one exception per library or namespace
and have an exception reason within that exception to indicate the type of the exception.
</a><p>

<a name="coeeal">For example, for your OS encapsulation libary, make an exception called OsencapException.
</a></p><p>

<a name="coeeal">By using just one exception you make it easy for people using your code to catch your
exception. If you have thousand exceptions it is impossible for anyone to handle those.
And as exceptions are added you will break existing code that thinks they are handling
all your exceptions.
</a></p><p>

<a name="coeeal">If you think you need to create derived exceptions the derive them from your libraries'
base exception class. That allows your library users to still catch the base class
exception if they wish.
</a></p><p>

<a name="coeeal">Most exceptions are things the code can't do anything about anyway, so creating
lots of exceptions to express every little thing that can go wrong with a 
separate class and is time confusing and confusing for the user. It's not necessary.
</a></p><p>

<a name="coeeal">Make sure to document that an exception is being thrown in you method comment header.
</a></p><p>

<a name="coeeal">Create a macro for throwing the exception so that you can transparently include __FILE__
and __LINE__ in the exception. This information is usefull when debugging. You can also
automatically take a time stamp and get the thread ID.
</a></p><p>

<a name="coeeal">The exception should take a one or two string arguments so developers can include all
the information they need in the exception without having to create a derived exception
to add a few more pieces of data.
</a></p><p>

<a name="coeeal">Include a stack trace of where the exception happened so you can log the stack
trace.
</a></p><p>

<a name="coeeal">Throwing an exception should take only one line of code. Don't uglify your code
with tons of exception handling. Make a macro that looks like:
</a></p><pre><a name="coeeal">THROW_NAMESPACE_EX_IF(cond, msg1, msg2, reason);
</a></pre>

<a name="coeeal">The condition causes the exception to be thrown when true. Msg1 and msg2 are local
context. Reason is the specific error code for the exception, if you think you
need it.
</a><p>

<a name="coeeal">Don't worry about running out of memory errors. Go ahead and allocate memory in your

<pre><a name="sbea">Write a function as if everything worked.

<h2><a name="sbea"> The Design by Contract Definition </a></h2>

<pre><a name="sbea">When an operation is invoked with it's pre-condition
satisfied, yet it cannot return with its post-condition
satisfied.
</a></pre>
<p>

<a name="sbea">There are those who say that exceptions should NOT be used to 
catch things like range errors. Here's why:
</a></p><p>

<a name="sbea">Range errors fall into a class of problem that are called <b>Programmer Errors</b>. 
Programmer errors are things that should NOT occur in a Bug Free Program.
Ideally, range type problems are one of those 
things that should be caught during development. It is for these problems that 
we have <b>Design By Contract</b>.
</a></p><p>

<a name="sbea">You program defensively by putting lots of asserts in 
to make sure that your program is functioning as expected. Then when you've 
committed a bug, like not checking user input properly, allowing an 
invalid index into an array to be derived, the assert macro catches it, and the 
program does a gracful crash.
</a></p><p>

<a name="sbea">Exceptions, on the other hand, should be used to catch problems that would 
arise even in a Bug Free Program, i.e. Exceptional Circumstances. The most 
perfect program can still be afflicted by things like shortage of memory and 
other resources, communications errors, and file problems. When one of these 
things occurs, an exception should be thrown, and caught at a point where the 
program can either deal with the problem, or close gracefully.
</a></p><p>

<a name="sbea">The real theory behind exceptions is to force the programmer to
anticipate things the programmer has no control over. 

Exceptions support the following kind of scenarios:
</a></p><ol>
<li><a name="sbea"> Logic error in the middle of a database
transaction. An exception would allow the program a chance to leave the
database in a consistent state. A trashed database can be very
expensive.
</a></li><li><a name="sbea"> Logic error in the middle of a program
that is using a resource ike a modem and the program runs unattended.
Exception handling would give the program a chance to hang up the modem
connection, rather than sit there with an connection until it's
discovered the next day, running up the phone bill.
</a></li><li><a name="sbea"> Logic error in the middle of something
like a word processor. Consider the user that has been working for a
couple of hours with unsaved edits, and your assert message pops up,
and the last two hours of work are pretty much lost - causing the user
some misery. If you used exception handling, you could at least give
the user a chance to salvage the unsaved document in a different file
as part of the cleanup.
</a></li></ol>


<h2><a name="sbea"> Design-by-Contract (DBC) </a></h2>

<a name="sbea">A design technique developed by Bertrand Meyer for 
producing "bug free" systems. 
</a><p>

<a name="sbea"><b>Design by Contract</b> (DBC) views the relationship between a class
and its clients as formal agreement, expressing each party's rights and
obligation. Rights and obligations are determined by a class'
specification. Correctness can only be determined in reference to
an object's specification. Specifications, in DBC, are expressed through
<b>assertions</b>.
</a></p><p>

<a name="sbea">Design by Contract is a development approach where a specification is associated
with every software element. These specifications (or contracts) govern
the interaction of the element with the rest of the world. A contract takes
form as a set of preconditions, postconditions, and invariants that are
run as the system executes. The contract is published in the comment block
of each method.
</a></p><p>


</p><h2><a name="sbea"> Assertion </a></h2>

<a name="sbea">A boolean statement that should never be false and,
therefore, will only be false because of a bug.
Typically assertions are checked only during debug 
and are not checked during production execution,
although they can be left in when performance and
memory size are not issues.
</a><p>

<a name="sbea">Design by Contract uses three kinds of assertions:
post-conditions, pre-conditions, and invariants.
Pre-conditions and post-conditions apply to operations. 
Invariants apply to the class.
</a></p><p>

</p><h2><a name="sbea"> Pre-condition </a></h2>

<a name="sbea">A statement of how we expect the <b>world to be before
we execute an operation</b>. We might design a pre-condition
of the "square" operation as <i>this &gt;= 0</i>. Such a 
pre-condition says that it is an error to invoke 
"square" on a negative number.
</a><p>

</p><h2><a name="sbea"> Post-condition </a></h2>

<a name="sbea">A statement of what the <b>world should look like
after execution of an operation</b>. For example, if
we define the operation "square" on a number, the
post-condition would take the form <i>result = this *this</i>.
The post-condition is a useful way of saying what we do without
saying how we do it- in other words, of separating
interface from implementation.
</a><p>

</p><h2><a name="sbea"> Invariant </a></h2>

<a name="sbea">An invariant is an assertion about a class. For instance,
an Account class may have an invariant that says that
<i>balance == sum(entries.amount())</i>. The invariant
is <b>always</b> true for all instances of the class.
"Always" means whenever the object is available for 
an operation to be invoked. During an operation
invariants may not be satisfied, but invariants must
hold when an operation has finished.
</a><p>


</p><h2><a name="sbea"> Is pop'ing an empty stack an exception? </a></h2>

<a name="sbea">When using a stack data structure is calling pop on an empty
stack an exception? This is the standard use case for the
endless discussions on what is and what isn't an
exception. The upshot is there is not a "right" answer.
In practice, as long as the library designer completely
documents their choice the library user shouldn't
make a mistake.
</a><p>

<a name="sbea">Let's apply our definition of exception.
</a></p><p>

</p><h3><a name="sbea"> The Clean Code View </a></h3>

<a name="sbea">If you write your application assuming everything works
then is pop returning null something you wouldn't expect?
It seems reasonable that if you ask for something it
may not be there.
</a><p>

<a name="sbea">Before calling pop the client can call isEmpty to check
if there's anything in the list. It's still possible
in a multi-threaded environment for the stack to return
null even if isEmpty returns true.
</a></p><p>

<a name="sbea">So don't use an exception. Pop returns data so it
should return null when empty.
</a></p><p>


</p><h3><a name="sbea"> The Design by Contract View </a></h3>


<a name="sbea">Should the library designer have as a pre-condition
that pop shouldn't be called when the stack is
empty? From an implementor point of view this could
seem reasonable. After all, why should an operation be called
when there's nothing there? So, pop could assert. 
</a><p>

<a name="sbea">But, library designers should alway see their clients
point-of-view. It's a bit extreme to
cause a system crash because pop has an empty stack.
There's nothing fundamentally or systemically wrong in
this scenario that would justify an assert.
</a></p><p>

<a name="sbea">It appears the pre-conditions are satisfied for
pop. Would any post-conditions not be satisfied?
(this defines an exception in DBC).
The stack should still be empty after the operation
so no post-conditions would be violated. Thus, by
definition an exception should not be thrown.

<h1> Be Careful Throwing Exceptions in Destructors </h1>

An object is presumably created to do something. Some of the
changes made by an object should persist after an object dies
(is destructed) and some changes should not. Take an object
implementing a SQL query. If a database field is updated via
the SQL object then that change should persist after the SQL
objects dies. To do its work the SQL object probably created
a database connection and allocated a bunch of memory.
When the SQL object dies we want to close the database connection
and deallocate the memory, otherwise if a lot of SQL objects
are created we will run out of database connections and/or memory.
<p>

The logic might look like:
</p><pre>Sql::~Sql()
{
   delete connection;
   delete buffer;
}
</pre>
<p>

Let's say an exception is thrown while deleting the database connection.
Will the buffer be deleted? No. Exceptions are basically non-local
gotos with stack cleanup. The code for deleting the buffer will never
be executed creating a gaping resource leak. 
</p><p>

Special care must be taken to catch exceptions which may occur during
object destruction. Special care must also be taken to fully destruct 
an object when it throws an exception.

</a><h1><a name="wwluas"> Working With Libaries Using All Sorts of Different Policies </a></h1>

<a name="wwluas">On many projects we have to work with C libraries that use error return
codes, old C++ libraries that use error return codes, and newer C++ libraries
that use exceptions. How should all these different approaches work together?
</a><p>

<a name="wwluas">Ideally exceptions should be used where possible because that's the where
all new code is going. But I also see new libraries being forced to use
error return codes because the old libraries use them and application maintainers
don't want you to use exceptions.
</a></p><p>

<a name="wwluas">In C++ any method can throw an exception and you can't tell. In Java you know
when you are not catching an exception. Not in C++.
So what happens is that if a new library comes in and throws an exception, a 
crticial program may start failing because an exception is not caught. This
may make everyone use error codes instead of exceptions.
</a></p><p>

<a name="wwluas">Don't give into this old timer bias. Error return codes are virtually useless
because they are competely ingorable. Instead, an application should just wrap
their code in a big try catch block that catches all exceptions. That way
an application won't die with prejudice and C++ libarary writers can make
use of exceptions in their design.

<a name="misc"></a>
<h1> Miscellaneous </h1>

This section contains some miscellaneous do's and don'ts. 
<p>

</p><ul>
<li> Don't use floating-point variables where discrete values are needed. Using
     a float for a loop counter is a great way to shoot yourself in the foot.
     Always test floating-point numbers as &lt;= or &gt;=, never use an exact
     comparison (== or !=).
<p>

</p></li><li> Compilers have bugs. Common trouble spots include structure assignment and
     bit fields. You cannot generally predict which bugs a compiler has. 
     You could write a program that avoids all constructs that are known 
     broken on all compilers. You won't be able to write anything useful, 
     you might still encounter bugs, and the compiler might get fixed in 
     the meanwhile. Thus, you should write ``around'' compiler bugs only 
     when you are forced to use a particular buggy compiler.
<p>

</p></li><li> Do not rely on automatic beautifiers. The main person who benefits from
     good program style is the programmer him/herself, and especially in 
     the early design of handwritten algorithms or pseudo-code. 
     Automatic beautifiers can only be applied to complete, syntactically 
     correct programs and hence are not available when the need for 
     attention to  white space and indentation is greatest. Programmers 
     can do a better job of making clear the complete visual layout of a 
     function or file, with the normal attention to detail of a careful 
     programmer (in other words, some of the visual layout is dictated by 
     intent rather than syntax and beautifiers cannot read minds). Sloppy 
     programmers should learn to be careful programmers instead of relying 
     on a beautifier to make their code readable.  Finally, since beautifiers 
     are non-trivial programs that must parse the source, a sophisticated 
     beautifier is not worth the benefits gained by such a program. 
     Beautifiers are best for gross formatting of machine-generated code.
<p>

</p></li><li> Accidental omission of the second ``='' of the logical compare is a
     problem. The following is confusing and prone to error.
     <pre>        if (abool= bbool) { ... }
     </pre>

     Does the programmer really mean assignment here? Often yes,
     but usually no. The solution is to just not do it, an inverse 
     Nike philosophy. Instead use explicit tests and avoid 
     assignment with an implicit test.
     The recommended form is to do the assignment before doing the test:
    <pre><tt>
       abool= bbool;
       if (abool) { ... }
    </tt></pre>
<p>

</p></li><li> Modern compilers will put variables in registers automatically. Use the
     register sparingly to indicate the variables that you think are most 
     critical. In extreme cases, mark the 2-4 most critical values as 
     register and mark the rest as REGISTER. The latter can be #defined 
     to register on those machines with many registers.
</li></ul>


<p></p><hr> <a name="const"></a>
<h1> Be Const Correct </h1>

C++ provides the <i>const</i> key word to allow passing as parameters 
objects that cannot change to indicate when a method doesn't modify 
its object. Using const in all the right places is called
"const correctness." 
<p>

It's hard at first, but using const really tightens 
up your coding style. Const correctness grows on you.
</p><p>

If you don't use const correctness from the start it can be nightmare
to add it in later because it causes a chain reaction of needing
const everywhere. It's better to start being const correct from
the start or you probably won't be.
</p><p>

You can always cast aways constness when necessary, but it's better
not to.
</p><p>


For more information see Const Correctness in the C++ FAQ.

</a><h1><a name="constplace"> Placement of the Const Qualifier </a></h1>

<a name="constplace">When you combine const with pointers it can become quite confusing as to what const means. For example, is "const int * = NULL" 
an unchangeable pointer or is the int that it points to unchangeable? I know it always confuses me. Reese Anschultz suggested an
alternate standard syntax that I've never tried, but it makes sense, so here it is:
</a><pre><a name="constplace">int const = constant integer
int const * = pointer to constant integer
int const * const = constant pointer to constant integer
int const * const * = pointer to constant pointer to constant integ
</a></pre>

<a name="constplace">This looks disturbingly different than the more common "const int A_GLOBAL_CONSTANT= 5" syntax we are used to seeing.
But, according to the standards, the qualifier modifies everything to its left with the special exception where the qualifier 
precedes the first type and modifies just that type. Since there is one generalized form that works for all occasions, it 
is more consistent to always put the qualifier to the right of whatever is qualified. 




</a><p><a name="constplace"> </a></p><hr><a name="constplace"> </a><a name="streams"></a>
<h1> Use Streams </h1>

Programmers transitioning from C to C++ find stream IO strange
preferring the familiarity of good old stdio. Printf and gang
seem to be more convenient and are well understood.
<p>

</p><h2> Type Safety </h2>

Stdio is not type safe, which is one of the reasons you
are using C++, right? Stream IO is type safe. That's one good
reason to use streams.
<p>

</p><h2> Standard Interface </h2>

When you want to dump an object to a stream there is
a standard way of doing it: with the <i>&lt;&lt;</i> operator.
This is not true of objects and stdio. 

<h2> Interchangeablity of Streams </h2>

One of the more advanced reasons for using streams is that
once an object can dump itself to a stream it can dump itself
to any stream. One stream may go to the screen, but another stream
may be a serial port or network connection. Good stuff.

<h2> Streams Got Better </h2>

Stream IO is not perfect. It is however a lot better than
it used to be. Streams are now standardized, acceptably efficient,
more reliable, and now there's lots of documentation on how to use 
streams. 

<h2> Check Thread Safety </h2>

Some stream implementations are not yet thread safe. Make sure
that yours is.

<h2> But Not Perfect </h2>

For an embedded target tight on memory streams do not make sense.
Streams inline a lot of code so you might find the image
larger than you wish. Experiment a little. Streams might
work on your target.


<p></p><hr><a name="nomagic"></a>
<h1> No Magic Numbers </h1>

A magic number is a bare naked number used in source code. It's magic
because no-one has a clue what it means including the author inside
3 months. For example: <p>
</p><pre>if      (22 == foo) { start_thermo_nuclear_war(); }
else if (19 == foo) { refund_lotso_money(); }
else if (16 == foo) { infinite_loop(); }
else                { cry_cause_im_lost(); }
</pre> 

In the above example what do 22 and 19 mean? If there was a number change or the
numbers were just plain wrong how would you know? <p? heavy="" use="" of="" magic="" numbers="" marks="" as="" an="" amateur="" more="" than="" anything="" else.="" programmer="" worked="" in="" team="" environment="" nor="" has="" had="" to="" maintain="" code="" or="" they="" would="" never="" do="" such="" a="" thing.=""><p>

Instead of magic numbers use a real name that means something. You can use 
<i>#define</i> or constants or enums as names. Which one is a design choice. For example:
</p><pre>#define   PRESIDENT_WENT_CRAZY  (22)
const int WE_GOOFED= 19;
enum 
{
   THEY_DIDNT_PAY= 16
};

if      (PRESIDENT_WENT_CRAZY == foo) { start_thermo_nuclear_war(); }
else if (WE_GOOFED            == foo) { refund_lotso_money(); }
else if (THEY_DIDNT_PAY       == foo) { infinite_loop(); }
else                                  { happy_days_i_know_why_im_here(); }
</pre>

Now isn't that better? The const and enum options are preferable
because when debugging the debugger has enough information to display
both the value and the label. The #define option just shows up as
a number in the debugger which is very inconvenient. The const
option has the downside of allocating memory. Only you know if this
matters for your application.
<p>



</p><p></p><hr><a name="errorret"></a>
<h1> Error Return Check Policy </h1> 

<ul>
<li> Check every system call for an error return, unless you know
     you wish to ignore errors. For example, <i>printf</i>
     returns an error code but rarely would you check for its
     return code. In which case you can cast the return
     to <b>(void)</b> if you really care.
</li><li> Include the system error text for every system error message.
</li><li> Check every call to malloc or realloc unless you know your
     versions of these calls do the right thing. You might want to have
     your own wrapper for these calls, including new, so you can do
     the right thing always and developers don't have to make 
     memory checks everywhere.
</li></ul>


<p></p><hr><a name="useenums"></a> 
<h1> To Use Enums or Not to Use Enums </h1>

C++ allows constant variables, which should deprecate the
use of enums as constants. Unfortunately, in most compilers 
constants take space. Some compilers will remove constants,
but not all. Constants taking space precludes them from being
used in tight memory environments like embedded systems.
Workstation users should use constants and ignore the rest
of this discussion.
<p>

In general enums are preferred to <i>#define</i> as
enums are understood by the debugger.
</p><p>

Be aware enums are not of a guaranteed size. So if you have a 
type that can take a known range of values and it is transported 
in a message you can't use an enum as the type. Use the correct 
integer size and use constants or <i>#define</i>. Casting
between integers and enums is very error prone as you could
cast a value not in the enum.

</p><h2> A C++ Workaround </h2>

C++ allows static class variables. These variables are available 
anywhere and only the expected amount of space is taken.

<h3> Example </h3>
<pre>class Variables
{
public:
   static const int   A_VARIABLE;
   static const int   B_VARIABLE;
   static const int   C_VARIABLE;
}
</pre>


<p></p><hr><a name="macros"></a>
<h1> Macros </h1>

<h2> Don't Turn C++ into Pascal </h2>

Don't change syntax via macro substitution. It makes the program
unintelligible to all but the perpetrator.

<h2> Replace Macros with Inline Functions </h2>

In C++ macros are not needed for code efficiency. Use inlines.

<h3> Example </h3>

<pre>#define  MAX(x,y)	(((x) &gt; (y) ? (x) : (y))	// Get the maximum
</pre>
<p>

The macro above can be replaced for integers with the following inline function
with no loss of efficiency:
</p><pre>   inline int 
   max(int x, int y)
   {
      return (x &gt; y ? x : y);
   }
</pre>

<h2> Be Careful of Side Effects </h2>

Macros should be used with caution because of the potential for error when
invoked with an expression that has side effects.

<h3> Example </h3>

<pre>   MAX(f(x),z++);
</pre>


<h2> Always Wrap the Expression in Parenthesis </h2>

When putting expressions in macros always wrap the expression 
in parenthesis to avoid potential communitive operation ambiguity.

<h3> Example </h3>

<pre>#define ADD(x,y) x + y

must be written as 

#define ADD(x,y) ((x) + (y))
</pre>

<h2> Make Macro Names Unique </h2>

Like global variables macros can conflict with macros from
other packages. 
<ol>
<li> Prepend macro names with package names.
</li><li> Avoid simple and common names like MAX and MIN.
</li></ol>



<p></p><hr><a name="nztest"></a>
<h1> Do Not Default If Test to Non-Zero </h1>

Do not default the test for non-zero, i.e. 
<pre><tt>
   if (FAIL != f()) 
</tt></pre>

is better than 

<pre><tt>
   if (f()) 
</tt></pre>

even though FAIL may have the value 0 which C considers to be false. An
explicit test will help you out later when somebody decides that a failure
return should be -1 instead of 0. Explicit comparison should be used even if
the comparison value will never change; e.g., <b>if (!(bufsize % sizeof(int)))</b>
should be written instead as <b>if ((bufsize % sizeof(int)) == 0)</b> to reflect
the numeric (not boolean) nature of the test. A frequent trouble spot is using
strcmp to test for string equality, where the result should <em> never</em> 
<em> ever</em> be defaulted. The preferred approach is to define a macro
<em> STREQ</em>.
<p>

</p><pre><tt>
   #define STREQ(a, b) (strcmp((a), (b)) == 0) 
</tt></pre>
<p>

Or better yet use an inline method:

</p><pre><tt>
   inline bool
   StringEqual(char* a, char* b)
   {
      return strcmp(a, b) == 0;
   }
</tt></pre>
<p>

Note, this is just an example, you should really use the standard
library string type for doing the comparison.
</p><p>

The non-zero test is often defaulted for predicates and other functions or
expressions which meet the following restrictions: 

</p><ul>
<li> Returns 0 for false, nothing else.
</li><li> Is named so that the meaning of (say) a <b>true</b> return is absolutely
     obvious. Call a predicate IsValid(), not CheckValid(). 
</li></ul>
<p>


</p><p></p><hr><a name="boolean"></a>
<h1> The Bull of Boolean Types </h1>

Any project using source code from many sources knows the pain
of multiple conflicting boolean types. The new C++ standard
defines a native boolean type. Until all compilers support
bool, and existing code is changed to use it, we must still 
deal with the cruel world.
<p>

The form of boolean most accurately matching the new standard is:
</p><pre><tt>
   typedef int     bool;
   #define TRUE    1
   #define FALSE   0

or

   const int TRUE  = 1;
   const int FALSE = 0;
</tt></pre>

Note, the standard defines the names <b>true</b> and <b>false</b>
not TRUE and FALSE. The all caps versions are used to not clash
if the standard versions are available.
<p>

Even with these declarations, do not check a boolean value for equality with 1
(TRUE, YES, etc.); instead test for inequality with 0 (FALSE, NO, etc.). Most
functions are guaranteed to return 0 if false, but only non-zero if true. Thus,

</p><pre><tt>
   if (TRUE == func()) { ... 
</tt></pre>

must be written 

<pre><tt>
   if (FALSE != func()) { ... 
</tt></pre>
<p>


</p><p></p><hr><a name="eassign"></a>
<h1> Usually Avoid Embedded Assignments </h1>

There is a time and a place for embedded assignment statements. In some
constructs there is no better way to accomplish the results without making the
code bulkier and less readable.
<p>

</p><pre><tt>
   while (EOF != (c = getchar())) 
   {
      process the character
   }
</tt></pre>
<p>

The ++ and -- operators count as assignment statements. So, for many purposes,
do functions with side effects. Using embedded assignment statements to
improve run-time performance is also possible. However, one should consider
the tradeoff between increased speed and decreased maintainability that results
when embedded assignments are used in artificial places. For example, 
</p><pre><tt>
   a = b + c;
   d = a + r; 
</tt></pre>

should not be replaced by 

<pre><tt>
   d = (a = b + c) + r; 
</tt></pre>

even though the latter may save one cycle. In the long run the time difference
between the two will decrease as the optimizer gains maturity, while the
difference in ease of maintenance will increase as the human memory of what's
going on in the latter piece of code begins to fade.
<p>


</p><p></p><hr><a name="reuse"></a>
<h1> Reusing Your Hard Work and the Hard Work of Others </h1> 

Reuse across projects is almost impossible without
a common framework in place. Objects conform to the
services available to them. Different projects
have different service environments making object reuse
difficult.

<p>

Developing a common framework takes a lot of up front
design effort. When this effort is not made, for
whatever reasons, there are several techniques
one can use to encourage reuse:
</p><p>

</p><h2> Ask! Email a Broadcast Request to the Group </h2>

This simple technique is rarely done. For some reason
programmers feel it makes them <b>seem</b> less capable
if they ask others for help. This is silly! Do new
interesting work. Don't reinvent the same stuff over
and over again.
<p>

<b>
If you need a piece of code email to the group asking if 
someone has already done it. The results can be surprising. 
</b></p><p>

In most large groups individuals have no idea what other people 
are doing. You may even find someone is looking for something
to do and will volunteer to do the code for you. There's always a 
gold mine out there if people work together.

</p><h2> Tell! When You do Something Tell Everyone </h2>

Let other people know if you have done something reusable.
Don't be shy. And don't hide your work to protect your pride.
Once people get in the habit of sharing work everyone gets
better.

<h2> Don't be Afraid of Small Libraries </h2>

One common enemy of reuse is people not making
libraries out of their code. A reusable class may be
hiding in a program directory and will never have
the thrill of being shared because the programmer
won't factor the class or classes into a library.
<p>

One reason for this is because people don't like making small
libraries. There's something about small libraries that
doesn't feel right. Get over it. The computer doesn't care
how many libraries you have. 
</p><p>

If you have code that can be reused and can't be placed in an 
existing library then make a new library. Libraries don't stay 
small for long if people are really thinking about reuse.
</p><p>

If you are afraid of having to update makefiles when libraries
are recomposed or added then don't include libraries in your
makefiles, include the idea of <b>services</b>. Base level makefiles
define services that are each composed of a set of libraries. 
Higher level makefiles specify the services they want. When the 
libraries for a service change only the lower level makefiles will 
have to change.
</p><p>

</p><h2> Keep a Repository </h2>

Most companies have no idea what code they have. And most
programmers still don't communicate what they have done or
ask for what currently exists. The solution is to keep
a repository of what's available.
<p>

In an ideal world a programmer could go to a web page, browse
or search a list of packaged libraries, taking what they
need. If you can set up such a system where programmers
voluntarily maintain such a system, great. If you have a
librarian in charge of detecting reusability, even better.
</p><p>

Another approach is to automatically generate a repository
from the source code. This is done by using common
class, method, library, and subsystem headers that can double as man
pages and repository entries.

<h1> Commenting Out Large Code Blocks </h1>

Sometimes large blocks of code need to be commented out for testing.

<h2> Using #if 0 </h2>

The easiest way to do this is with an #if 0 block:
<pre>   void 
   example()
   {
      great looking code

      #if 0
      lots of code
      #endif
    
      more code
    }
</pre>
<p>

You can't use <b>/**/</b> style comments because comments can't
contain comments and surely a large block of your code will contain 
a comment, won't it?
</p><p>

Don't use #ifdef as someone can unknowingly trigger ifdefs from the
compiler command line.


</p><h2> Use Descriptive Macro Names Instead of 0 </h2>

The problem with <b>#if 0</b> is that even day later you or anyone
else has no idea why this code is commented out. Is it because
a feature has been dropped? Is it because it was buggy? It didn't
compile? Can it be added back? It's a mystery. 

<h3> Use Descriptive Macro Names Instead of #if 0 </h3>

<pre>#if NOT_YET_IMPLEMENTED  

#if OBSOLETE

#if TEMP_DISABLED 
</pre>

<h3> Add a Comment to Document Why </h3>

Add a short comment explaining why it is not implemented, obsolete or 
temporarily disabled.


<p> </p><hr> <a name="ifdef"></a>
<h1> Use #if Not #ifdef </h1>

Use #if MACRO not #ifdef MACRO. Someone might write code like:

<pre>#ifdef DEBUG
        temporary_debugger_break();
#endif
</pre>

Someone else might compile the code with turned-of debug info like:

<pre>cc -c lurker.cpp -DDEBUG=0
</pre>

Alway use #if, if you have to use the preprocessor. This works fine, and 
does the right thing, even if DEBUG is not defined at all (!)

<pre>#if DEBUG
        temporary_debugger_break();
#endif
</pre>

If you really need to test whether a symbol is defined or not, test it 
with the defined() construct, which allows you to add more things later 
to the conditional without editing text that's already in the program:

<pre>#if !defined(USER_NAME)
 #define USER_NAME "john smith"
#endif
</pre>

</a><h1><a name="reentrant"> Make Functions Reentrant </a></h1>

<a name="reentrant">Functions should not keep static variables that prevent
a function from being reentrant. Functions can declare
variables static. Some C library functions in the past,
for example, kept a static buffer to use a temporary 
work area. Problems happen when the function is called one or
more times at the same time. This can happen when
multiple tasks are used or say from a signal handler.
Using the static buffer caused results to overlap
and become corrupted. 
</a><p>

<a name="reentrant">The moral is make your functions reentrant by not using static 
variables in a function.
Besides, every machine has 128MB of RAM now so we don't
worry about buffer space any more :-)




</a></p><p></p><hr><a name="raii">         
</a><h1><a name="raii"> Use the Resource Acquisition is Initialization (RAII) Idiom </a></h1>

<a name="raii">RAII is a pattern useful in making sure allocated resources get freed.
What kind of resources? Memory usually. Could be file descriptors or locks
too. Anything that is allocated at one point and needs to be deleted at
another point in your code.
</a><p>

<a name="raii">C++ can help make this painless because of a feature I miss a lot in Java, that
your destructor is always called when an object leaves scope. This
feature has caused the creation of the Guard idiom. A Guard can be
wrapped around any resource so has to free the resource when the
guard goes out of scope.
</a></p><p>

<a name="raii">If you think you are always so careful to pair new and deletes that you
don't need to use one of those pattern thingies then I am sure I'll be
sitting beside you someday, like I have dozens of times before, searching
for resource leaks in your code. 
</a></p><p>

<a name="raii">The acquisition phase happens at construction. You are supposed to do all 
the initialization in the constructor so you can do all the cleaning up
in the destructor. And if you can guarantee through some different means
that the destructor is always called then you can be pretty sure you
won't leak.
</a></p><p>

<a name="raii">Some intialization sequences can't be done in the constructor, particularly
those using message driven state machines, but pretty much everything else
can. And for those things use RAII. The justification is that it will save
your butt from the many memory links that haunt large software products
written in C++.
</a></p><p>

<a name="raii">The key is to make sure the destructor is always called. The easiest way
is to use a stack variable. That way you know the destructor will be called
when leaving scope.
</a></p><p>

<a name="raii">For pointers you can use one of the many smart pointer variants like auto_ptr.
These will make sure your pointers are deleted when memory ownership is transferred
or the scope is exited. You can even use them as member variables so  you don't
have to write code in the destructor.
</a></p><p>

<a name="raii">If you can't use exceptions then this idiom isn't for you. As you are doing
a lot of work in the constructor you can have errors and you'll want throw
an exception.
</a></p><p>

<h1> Alignment of Class Members </h1> 

There seems to be disagreement on how to align class data 
members. Be aware that different platforms have different
alignment rules and it can be an issue. Alignment may also
be an issue when using shared memory and shared libraries.
<p>

The real thing to remember when it comes to alignment is to 
put the biggest data members first, and smaller members later, and to pad 
with char[] so that the same structure would be used no matter whether the 
compiler was in "naturally aligned" or "packed" mode.
</p><p>

For the Mac there's no blanket "always on four byte boundaries" rule -- rather, 
the rule is "alignment is natural, but never bigger than 4 bytes, unless the
member is a double and first in the struct in which case it is 8". And that 
rule was inherited from PowerOpen/AIX.

<p></p><hr><a name="promiss">
</a><h1><a name="promiss"> Promise of OO </a></h1>

<a name="promiss">OO has been hyped to the extent you'd figure it would solve world hunger
and usher in a new era of world peace. Not! OO is an approach, a philosophy,
it's not a recipe which blindly followed yields quality.
</a><p>

<a name="promiss">Robert Martin put OO in perspective:
</a></p><ul>
<li><a name="promiss">  OO, when properly employed, does enhance the reusability of
      software.  But it does so at the cost of complexity and design
      time.  Reusable code is more complex and takes longer to design
      and implement.  Furthermore, it often takes two or more tries
      to create something that is even marginally reusable.

</a></li><li><a name="promiss">  OO, when properly employed, does enhance the software's resilience
      to change.  But it does so at the cost of complexity and design
      time.  This trade off is almost always a win, but it is hard to
      swallow sometimes.  

</a></li><li><a name="promiss">  OO does not necessarily make anything easier to understand.
      There is no magical mapping between the software concepts and
      every human's map of the real world.  Every person is different.
      What one person percieves to be a simple and elegant design, another
      will perceive as convoluted and opaque.

</a></li><li><a name="promiss">  If a team has been able, by applying point 1 above, to create 
      a repository of reusable items, then development times can begin
      to shrink significantly due to reuse.

</a></li><li><a name="promiss">  If a team has been able, by applying point 2 above, to create
      software that is resilient to change, then maintenance of that
      software will be much simpler and much less error prone.
</a></li></ul>



<p></p><hr><a name="embedded">     
</a><h1><a name="embedded"> You can't use OO and C++ on Embedded Systems </a></h1>

<a name="embedded">Oh yes you can. I've used C++ on several embedded systems as
have many others. And if you can't why not? Please don't give in to vague
feelings and prejudice. An attitude best shown with a short exchange:
</a><pre><a name="embedded">Rube: Our packet driver is slow. We're only getting 100 packets per second.
Me  : Good thing you didn't do it in C++ huh?
Rube: Oh yah, it would have been really slow then!
Me  : (smiled secretly to myself)
</a></pre>

<a name="embedded">My initial response was prompted by a general unacceptance of C++ in the project
and blaming C++  for all problems. Of course all the parts written in C and
assembly had no problems :-) Embedded systems shops tend to be hardware driven
companies and tend not to know much about software development, thus any new
fangled concepts like OO and C++ are ridiculed without verbally accessible
reasons. Counter arguments like code that is fast and small and reusable don't
make a dent. Examples like improving the speed of a driver by inlining certain
methods and not hacking the code to death gently roll into the bit bucket.
</a><p>

</p><h2><a name="embedded"> Techniques </a></h2>

<a name="embedded">Of course C++ can be a disaster for an embedded system when used incorrectly, 
which of course is true of any tool. Here's some ideas to use C++ safely
in an embedded system:

</a><ul>
<li><a name="embedded"> Get Some Training! </a><p>

<a name="embedded">If people don't know C++ and OO then they will likely fail and blame
their tools. A good craftsperson doesn't blame their tools. Get training.
Hire at least one experienced person as guide/mentor.

</a></p><p>
</p></li><li><a name="embedded"> Be Careful Using Streams </a><p>

<a name="embedded">The streams library is large and slow. You are better off making a "fake"
streams library by overloading the &lt;&lt; operator. If you have a lot of
memory then use streams, they are convenient and useful.

</a></p><p>
</p></li><li><a name="embedded"> Be Careful Using Templates </a><p>

<a name="embedded">Code using templates can suffer from extreme code bloat. This is pretty
much a function of your compiler as templates can be efficiently used
when done correctly. Test your compiler for it how handles templates.
If it doesn't make a copy per file for each template then you are in business.
Templates have good time efficiency so they would be nice to use. 
</a></p><p>

<a name="embedded">You can fix the template code bloat problem by using explicit instantiation. 
Actually, even if the compiler generates one copy per source file. 
This, however, is often too much programmer work to expect on a large project, 
so be careful. Many linkers are smart enough to strip away all but one of the 
copies. 
</a></p><p>

<a name="embedded">Another issue to consider is template complexity. Templates can be complex 
for those new to C++. Bugs in templates are very hard to find and may overwhelm
the patience of users. 

</a></p><p>
</p></li><li><a name="embedded"> Exceptions Beware </a><p>

<a name="embedded">Embedded applications are usually interrupt driven and multi-threaded.
Test that exceptions are thread safe. Many compilers support exceptions,
but not thread safe exceptions. And you probably don't want to
call code in an interrupt that throws exceptions.

</a></p><p>
</p></li><li><a name="embedded"> Use Polymorphic Interfaces to Make Frameworks </a><p>

<a name="embedded">When you think through your design and come up with good abstractions you will
be shocked at how little code and how little time it takes to implement
new features.

</a></p><p>
</p></li><li><a name="embedded"> Make an OS Encapsulation Library </a><p>

<a name="embedded">Don't use your embedded OSs features directly. Create a layer that
encapsulates OS functions and use those encapsulations. Most feature like
tasks, interrupts, semaphores, message queues, messages, etc. are common to all 
systems. With good encapsulations it's quite possible to have the same code 
compile for Solaris, VxWorks, Windows, and other systems. It just takes a 
little thought.

</a></p><p>
</p></li><li><a name="embedded"> ROM Beware </a><p>

<a name="embedded">A lot of systems create a ROM and download code later over the network that is
linked against the ROM. Something to remember is linkers will try and include
only code that is used. So your ROM may not contain code that loaded code expects
to be there. You need to include all functions in your ROM.

</a></p><p>
</p></li><li><a name="embedded"> Multiple Interface Levels </a><p>

<a name="embedded">Most embedded systems have a command line interface which usually requires C linkage,
then they may have an SNMP interface, and they may have some sort of other
friendly interface. Design this up front to be common across all code. It will
make your life much easier. C functions require access to global pointers so they
can use objects. The singleton pattern makes this easier. </a></p><p>

<a name="embedded">Come up with common naming conventions. A decent one is:
</a></p><ul>
<li><a name="embedded"> Make up a module abbreviation that can be prefixed to all calls. For example:
     <b>log</b> for the logging module.
</a></li><li><a name="embedded"> Encode an action after the prefix. For example: logHelp which prints help for
     the logging module.
</a></li><li><a name="embedded"> Require a certain set of functions for each sub system: For example:
     </a><ul>
<a name="embedded">     </a><li><a name="embedded"> moduleHelp  - prints help for the module
     </a></li><li><a name="embedded"> modulePrint - prints the current state of the module
     </a></li><li><a name="embedded"> moduleStart - start a module
     </a></li><li><a name="embedded"> moduleStop  - stop a module
     </a></li><li><a name="embedded"> moduleSetDebug - set the debug level for a module. It's very nice to set
                           debug levels on a module by module basis.
     </a></li></ul>
</li></ul>


<p>
</p></li><li><a name="embedded"> Debug and Error System First </a><p>

<a name="embedded">Make your debug and error system first so everyone writing code will use it.
It's very hard to retrofit code with debug output and intelligent use of error
codes. If you have some way to write system assert errors to NVRAM, disk, or
some other form of persistent storage so you can recover it on the next reboot.

</a></p><p>
</p></li><li><a name="embedded"> Think About Memory </a><p>

<a name="embedded">Think how you'll share memory buffers between ISR code and task level code.
Think how fast your default memory allocator is, it is probably slow. Think
if your processor supports purify! Think how you'll track memory corruption
and leakage.

</a></p><p>
</p></li><li><a name="embedded"> Think About System Integrity </a><p>

<a name="embedded">You need to design up front how you are going to handle watchdog functions
and test that the system is still running and not corrupted.
</a></p><p>

</p></li><li><a name="embedded"> Remember to Use Volatile </a><p>

<a name="embedded">When using memory mapped I/O make sure that you 
declare the input port variables as volatile, (some compilers do this 
automatically), since the value can change without notice, and the optimizer 
could eliminate what looks like a redundant access to that variable. Not
using volatile leads to some very obscure bugs. If you suspect problems
in this area take a look at the generated code to make sure read-only
assumptions are being made.
</a></p><p>

<a name="embedded">Sometimes the keyword volatile is ifdef'd out for portability
reasons. Check that what you think is volatile is really declared as
volatile.
</a></p></li></ul>

ROTELLA DESIGN

* Command Execution

When the "rotella" command is executed the following tasks are performed sequentially:

    1. parsing and processing of command arguments
    2. parsing and processing of the configuration file
    3. bootstrap to get an initial list of nodes
    4. show prompt and process further user instructions
